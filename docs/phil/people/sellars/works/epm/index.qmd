# Quotes 

## Scientium mensura {#scientium}
> In the dimension of describing and explaining the world, science is the measure
of all of things. Of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not.

- Unfortunately, the opening qualification is important but usually left out.

## Space of reasons
> In characterizing an episode or a state as *knowing*, we are not giving an
 empirical description of it. We are placing it in the logical space of reasons, 
 of justifying and being able to justify what one says. [-@sellars1956empiricism]

- Note, there's nothing too special about *knowing*. He could also have said *believing*.
- We're *doing* something, an act that's not *describing* something.
- Relates to the scientium mensura quote - we have an example of something 
  (describing knowledge) as something that science is not the measure of all 
  things about.
- [Rorty](/docs/phil/people/rorty/index.qmd) characterized Sellars 
  readership as "right wing" (ones who felt the 
  greatest philosophical illumination from "scientium mensura") vs "left wing" 
  (who rally behind the "space of reasons").
- The Vienna circle, too, had two wings (the 
  [naturalist](/docs/phil/definitions/naturalism.qmd) wing (Neurath) and the 
  [empiricist](/docs/phil/definitions/empiricism.qmd) wing (Schlict)) in 
  tension (e.g. empiricists making sense of modal 
  statements). [Carnap](/docs/phil/people/carnap/index.qmd) struggled to 
  hold them together.
- Joke: [Rorty](/docs/phil/people/rorty/index.qmd) says "I hope the left and 
  right wing Sellarsians can sort their 
  differences out in the end more peacefully than the left and right wing 
  Hegelians did, who settled it once and for all at a 6 month seminar called 
  The Battle of Stalingrad."

Recall the [example](/docs/math/examples/set_smc.qmd) with **Set** as a 
symmetric moniodal category. 
Apply the definition of a $\mathcal{V}$ 
[category](/docs/math/defs/enrich_smc.qmd) and see if this 
agrees with the definition of an ordinary [category](/docs/math/defs/cat.qmd). 
Is there a subtle difference?

## Solution
We've replaced the identity morphisms with maps from the monoidal unit, but 
that is functionally equivalent to 'just picking one' given that the initial 
object is a singleton.

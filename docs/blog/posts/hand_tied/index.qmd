Here are four potentially-unrelated examples with a common structure:

- there are (at least) two ways to achieve some goal
- one is harder than the other 
- there is a deeper kind of payoff to taking the harder route 

# 1. Constructive mathematics

Many things in math can be proven without relying on the 
[law of the excluded middle](/docs/phil/Law of the excluded middle.html), which says, 
for any claim $P$, you can assert that $P$ or not-$P$ is true. Using this 
additional axiom can make things easier; however, proofs using it will not be
*constructive*. For example: 

- a constructive 
  [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2#Constructive_proof) 
  that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational is a mechanism which, 
  for any rational number $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ it is fed, constructs the nonzero 
  difference $q - \sqrt{2}$. A non-constructive proof (e.g. assuming 
  $\sqrt{2}$ is rational,
  then proving a contradiction, then concluding $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational) 
  says that $\sqrt{2}$ 
  is irrational but cannot be used to automatically derive a contradiction from
  someone asserting that, say, $\frac{99}{70}$ is equal to $\sqrt{2}$.

- A constructive proof of the infinitude of prime numbers will take a purported 
  set of all prime numbers (call it $P$) and produce a number $p\prime$ outside 
  that set
  that is prime ${(p\prime = 1+\underset{p \in P}{\prod} p)}$. 
  A non-constructive proof would 
  tell you that $P$ is infinite without giving you any concrete witness of 
  this fact.



One might argue that a constructive proof is a stronger form of evidence than 
a non-constructive proof. Not just definitionally, by using fewer axioms, 
but in a practical sense: constructive proofs 
have computational content that witnesses the proof in a concrete way and 
can be excecuted by a computer.

# 2. Universal properties

Here, we take aim at a particular attitude towards mathematics:

- to understand an object is to understand its constituent parts, i.e. how it is 
constructed. 

An alternative viewpoint is motivated by category theory: 

- to understand 
an object is to understand how it relates to everything else

The latter approach makes it more work to understand something, for example:

- Suppose we have two sets of things, $A$ and $B$. The cartesian product of sets, 
  $A \times B$ can be *defined* as the set of 
  pairs $(a,b)$ for all $a$ in $A$ and for all $b$ in $B$. 
  This is very straightforward. In 
  constrast, the category-theoretic 
  [characterization of a product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory)) 
  describes how $A \times B$ relates to everything else rather 
  than describing what $A \times B$ is *in itself*, the details of which are 
  left to a footnote.[^1] 

[^1]: You can pick whatever representation you want for $A \times B$, but for it to act as a 
  product, it must be able to take *any* pair of functions like in the figure 
  below and derive a *unique* function which first maps into it and then applies
  the projection maps (e.g. *get rank* or *get suit*) to recover the original 
  pair of functions. In the case of the $(a,b)$ encoding, this unique map sends 
  "low" to $(1, \spadesuit)$ and "high" to $(A, \clubsuit)$.

- The set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ can be *defined* as the set 
  $\{0, 1, 2, ...\}$. This is very straightforward. In contrast, the category-
  theoretic [characterization of the natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_numbers_object)
  is very involved because we aren't allowed to say "what is *in* the set", only 
  how the "natural numbers" (whatever that may be) must relate to other things 
  in a given context if it is worthy of being called the "natural numbers" of 
  that context. 

What are the upshots of the categorical approach, which forbids us from talking 
about the constituent parts of the thing we're trying to describe? Here are two:

- **Generality**: we define *product* once and then realize that tons of things 
  that appear in many different contexts are actually the exact categorical 
  definition of product, but specialized to different categories (e.g. multiplying 
  numbers, intersections of sets, the greatest common divisor, logical **AND**, etc.). 
- **Essence**: the definition of $\mathbb{N}$ given set-theoretic foundations 
  might mean that it literally is the set 
  $\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\},\ \{\{\varnothing\}\},\ ...\}$. Though 
  one could also encode the natural numbers as 
  $\{\varnothing,\ \{\varnothing\},\ \{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\},\ ...\}$ 
  or a very different way, e.g.
  the number $3$ defined as the set of all sets with three elements. These 
  can have very different properties that we morally ought to ignore, such as 
  whether or not $a \subseteq b$ (in their encoding) iff $a \leq b$ as naturals,
  because these are "implementation details". The category-theoretic 
  characterization forbids us from looking at implementation details, which is 
  an advantage in the long run even if it makes things more complicated at the 
  start.[^2] 
  
[^2]: When programming, we can also take advantage of implementation details 
      to do some things easier - it is likewise not a good idea to do 
      this, in the long run.

# 3. Pragmatist semantics 

It's often important that we clarify the meaning of our statements, such as
"The robot is not conscious" or "There do not exist any ghosts." A 
theory of semantics is helpful to make explicit how to do this clarification.

We could adopt the "view from nowhere": 
we imagine there is a "true model" of the world as it is in itself. Perhaps this lists out 
all the primitive objects and primitive relationships between them. If one could analyze 
this "true model", one could say the *meaning* of "conscious" is a predicate 
which holds over objects in the model.[^5] This is called 
*representatationalism* - an ideology that says the meaning of 
thought and talk should be understood principally in terms of the 
representational relations that thinkings and sayings stand in to what they 
(purport to) represent. It gives us an easy template 
for saying, for any $\phi$, what $\phi$ 
means: namely, that $\phi$ is only true if the objective world is 
configured in such-and-such way. It's so pervasive that it might 
feel ridiculous to consider any alternative. However, there are issues: 

- How are we supposed to achieve the "view from nowhere" in practice? What good 
  is this semantic account if that is in principle impossible?
- We must imagine the "objective model of the world" to be specified in *some* 
  vocabulary, but it's not any of our vocabularies (even our scientific ones), 
  so how could our predicates actually hook up to the objects of the objective 
  world?
- Many meaningful concepts (such as mathematics, possibility/necessity, ethics)
  evade a satisfying descriptive account. This sometimes leads people to
  conclude those concepts are not what we originally thought (e.g. "evil" turns 
  out to be just a way we talk about things we *really* dislike, or "necessity" 
  turns out to be just how we feel about stuff that happens *really* regularly) 
  rather than questioning the  semantic model of descriptivism.
- Descriptivism would make it seem like every statement we make crucially hinges on
  whether or not things 'actually exist'. Yet many everyday examples (e.g. 
  [witches](/docs/phil/referring to witches.qmd),
  [Pluto](/docs/phil/pluto.qmd),
  [beauty](/docs/phil/interaction/sense dependence vs reference.qmd), and
  [sour acid](/docs/phil/sour acid.qmd)) show that 
  ordinary statements are not like this.

The philosophical school of pragmatism offers an alternative target vocabulary 
for explaining semantics, one that does not have to resort to the 
"view from nowhere." Rather, one explains meanings in terms of social practices 
(sometimes thought of as "language games"), rather than some sort of direct 
relationship between the expression 
and the world. 

- Think of the difference between: "*Rojo* in Spanish and *rot* in 
  German mean the same thing because they pick out the same objects in the world"
  *versus* "...because *rojo* plays the same role in Spanish that *rot* plays in 
  German."

One pragmatist analysis of 'sentience' might conclude that sentience is 
not a property of agents (nor the presence of "mind stuff"). Rather, a sentient
agent is (to first approximation) one whose verbal noises can be given the 
social significance of being *judgments*.

- Making a judgment both makes us *responsible* for something as well as *entitles* 
  us to making other inferences.
- Think of the difference of a parrot squacking "The building is on fire" and 
  an adult saying the same. Our difference in how we initially react (and how 
  we treat the speaker if it turns out to be false) reflects the different 
  social status of the parrot and human (the difference between mere words and a 
  judgment).
- Sentience can be explained in terms of this social status by pragmatists, without 
  referring to some "true model" of the world 
  (beyond the ordinary and accessible world of speakers and talking).

[^5]: Think of a 'predicate' as a function which takes in the 
      identity of the object and evaluates it to tell you whether the property 
      holds or not.

# 4. Anti-authoritarianism 

We have opinions on how the world should work. For example, the world might 
be better if everyone stopped drinking sugary soda, or spanking their kids,
or eating meat. Politics involves 
proposing ways to bring the world closer to how it should work, and the 
dead-simple way to characterize a system where people don't do X is to say: 
"X is illegal". *Any* alternative, i.e. working towards a system where people 
do X less yet X is still not *illegal*, takes more creativity and likely more 
work. For example, in the case of reducing meat eating:

- We could subsidize meat alternatives or urban agriculture.
- We can create public educational resources (e.g. inform people of the 
  environmental consequences, show visceral imagery of the slaughterhouse, 
  health benefits of vegetarianism, teach high schoolers how to cook)
- We could fund fundamental research about how to grow artificial meat.

What are the upshots in this scenario? For some, there are only practical 
reasons to not use coercion: it's hard to get the bill passed, or it will cost 
one's political party too much political capital, or it would be hard 
to enforce. For others, it feels like there is something immediately 
negative about coercion, and while it may be good to use coercion to stop
something even worse, it's still a case of picking the lesser of two evils. 
In the past, people were coercive for (what they thought) were the 
right reasons, but in retrospect they were wrong. This gives us pause when 
considering the use of force, to the extent that 
we are not absolutely sure that we are right in our belief of how the world 
should work.

# Conclusion

I started writing this without knowing what the common theme would be, but now I 
think of it as a cautionary tale about adopting a "God's-eye view" (even 
hypothetically!) because it is such a seductive idea that we inadvertently buy 
into it to some extent.

1. A God's-eye view can see whether a statement is true or false. 
    - there is no further need for a mechanism that (in a finite amount of time)
      demonstrates *why*.
    - The favoring of constructive over non-constructive proofs mirrors the 
      pragmatist tendency to have more interest in *justification* over truth.

2. A God's-eye view is does not have to observe things by observation but can 
  simply know objects *directly*. 
    - There is no worry that one has picked an 
      arbitrary encoding that might not cohere with other design choices and need 
      to be changed.
    - Our implementation details may be imperfect, while God's are and thus are 
      immutable (so we alone need to worry about depending on implementation 
      details which may change)

3. A God's-eye view in semantics ignores the inherent subjectivity of our 
   concepts. It forces one to engage in ontology and metaphysics. 
    - Category theory is filtering out the ontology.

4. A God's-eye view of politics would allow one to use one's omnipotence to 
  alter anything as one sees fit to achieve greater good. 
    - There is no worry about this good actually being mistaken or an 
      illusion, thus, without any humility, the ends will always justify the 
      means.
    - Rorty phrases Platonists (which he uses to characterize the god's-eye-view)
      as seeking to end the conversation, while pragmatism seeks to continue the 
      conversation. The former is more useful in practice for authoritarians.

Although it can feel like one is reasoning with one hand tied behind one's back 
when one refuses to invoke a God's-eye view, the short-term advantages of invoking it are 
outweighed by longer-term friction from the fact that we are not actually 
omniscient and omnipotent. Phrased another way, I believe there are pragmatic and 
moral benefits to showing this kind of restraint.[^mot]

# Quotes


## Community
> To say that a person desired to do A, thought it his duty to do B, but was 
forced to do C, is not to describe him as one might describe a scientific 
specimin. One does indeed describe him, but one does something more. And it's 
this 'something more' which is the irreducible core of the framework of persons. 
In what does this 'something more' consist? To think of a featherless bird as a 
person is to think of it as a being with which  one is bound up in a network of 
duties. From this point of view, the irreducibility of the personal is the 
irreducibility of the *ought* or the *is*. But even more basic than this to 
think of a featherless biped as a person is to construe its behavior in terms of 
actual or potential membership in an embracing group, each member of which 
thinks of itself as a member of the group. Let's call such a group a *community*.

- Deep connection between the normative, the social, and the self-conscious.

## Describing and explaining

> Although describing and explaining are distinguishable, they are also in an
important sense inseparable. The descripitive and explanatory resources of
language advance hand-in-hand.

- These two kinds of discursive activity, one can be describing in a
           particular act and not explaining (and vice-versa).
- Globally, they're only intelligible in terms of their relation to
          each other.
- The claim that matters: you couldn't have an  (autonomous discursive)
          language in use that had one and not the other.
- The reason is at least that in order to describe something you have
          to place it in a space of implications (i.e. the above quote)


## Exemplification
> Exemplification is a quasi-semantical relation, and it (and universals [^1])
is in the world only in that broad sense in which the
world includes linguistic norms and roles viewed from the standpoint of a
fellow participant.

- This plays off [Carnap](/docs/phil/people/carnap/index.qmd)'s notion of 
  'quasi-syntactical'.
- There's the narrow view of 'the world', that's the world that science is the 
  measure of all things. And the broader view of the world.

[^1]: e.g. redness, lionhood

## Is semantics psychological?

> The means of semantical statements is no more a psychological word than is
the ought of ethical statements or the must of modal statements.


- I think of this in the following way: the $\square$ operator can be applied to
statements to make them 'modal' (which could be alethic, deontic, or many other
things like ''Jones thinks that ..."). One such $\square$ is ''Semantically,
...'' (or, ''Literally, ...''). Ordinary statements made in practical life
 could be interpreted as having an implicit ''Pragmatically, ...'' (in fact,
 could we define *pragmatics* to be that which plays this role?)

## Judgment in the order of explanation

> Kant was on the right track when he insisted that, just as concepts are
essentially (not accidentally) items which can occur in judgments, so judgments
(and therefore indirectly concepts) are items that occur essentially (not
accidentally) that occur in reasonings or arguments.

- Turns a tradition (order of explanation: concepts -> judgments -> inferences)
on its head.

## Labeling vs Describing

> It's only because the expressions in terms of which we describe objects locate
them in a space of implications that they *describe* at all, rather than
merely *label*.

- Describing is what science is the measure of all things about.
- You can't do everything with just classification. It's not a rich enough 
  concept to get you to descriptions.

##  Man as rational animal
> To say that man is a rational animal is to say that man is a creature not of
habits but of rules. When God created Adam, He whispered in his ear, 'In all
contexts of action you will recognize rules, if only the rule to grope for rules
to recognize. When you cease to recognize rules, you will walk on four feet.'


## Modalities and norms {#transpose}
> The language of modalities is a transposed language of norms.

- (Related to [this quote](/docs/phil/people/sellars/works/cdcm/index.qmd#describing-the-world-without-modality)).
- What is the connection between the ([alethic](/docs/phil/definitions/alethic.qmd)) modal sense of *must* and the
 normative sense of *must*.
- [Carnap](/docs/phil/people/carnap/index.qmd) uses 'transposed' to talk about 
  an unquoted word used in a sentence as a
  transposed mode of speech (about use of a quoted-word).
  - E.g. "Red is a quality." vs  "'Red' is a one-place predicate.''

## Nondescriptive concepts
> Once the tautology 'the world is described by descriptive concepts' is freed
from the idea that the business of all non-logical concepts is to describe, the
 way is clear to an ungrudging recognition that many expressions which
 empiricists have relegated to second-class citizenship in discourse are not
 inferior, they're just different.

- *Descriptive* concepts are not the only kinds of concepts. There
  is a temptation of [empiricists](/docs/phil/definitions/empiricism.qmd) 
  in assimilating all expressions to
  descriptive expressions (such that anything not intelligible as
  descriptive is defective).
- The negation of this is called 
  [*decriptivism*](/docs/phil/definitions/descriptivism.qmd).
- The [Tractatus](/docs/phil/people/wittgenstein/works/tractatus/index.qmd) 
  was supremely descriptivist, yet made a key advance by
  noting that logical expressions play a different kind of role (prior to
  Tractatus, Russell would be looking into the world to try to see what
  distinguishes positive from negative facts, when he should not have
  been looking to the world).
- Sellars extends this even further. The later Wittgenstein saw
  language as playing an unsurveyable variety of roles.
- Most interesting philosophical concepts come with a "-ing"/ "-ed"
  distinction that's crucial. Is a justification an act of justifying vs
  what's justified (related to 
  [Agrippan trilemma](/docs/phil/problems/agrippan.qmd)). Is an experience 
  an act of experiencing vs what's experienced.


- You can't be inside the rules and outside talking about them at the same time.


## Subjunctive conditionals as essential
> We've established not only that subjunctive conditionals are the expressions 
of material rules of inference, but that the authority of those rules is not 
derivative from formal rules. In other words, we've shown that material rules 
of inference are essential to the language we speak, for we make constant use 
of subjunctive conditions. It's very tempting to conclude that material rules 
of inference are essential to languages containing descriptive terms.

## Transition to conceptual thinking {#transition}
> Anything which can properly be called 'conceptual thinking' can occur only 
within a framework of conceptual thinking in terms of which it can be critized, 
supported, refuted (in short, evaluated). To be able to think is to be able to 
measure one's thoughts by standards of correctness, of relevance, of evidence 
[^2]. In this sense the diversified conceptual framework is a whole which 
(however sketchy) is prior to its parts, and cannot be construed as a coming to 
gether of parts which are conceptual in character. The conclusion is difficult 
to avoid that the transition from preconceptual patterns of behavior to 
conceptual thinking is a holistic one, a jump to a level of awareness that is 
irreducibly new. A jump which was the coming of the being of man.

- Constrast with Wittegnsteinian image of "light dawning slowly on the whole". 
  Sellars is worried about the mechanism of how this happens.

[^2]: NB: in the space of justification

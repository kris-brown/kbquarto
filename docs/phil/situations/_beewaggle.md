The bee waggle dance is an 
[empirical phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance): when a 
foraging bee discovers a supply of food, it returns to the hive and does a 
waggle dance. The rest of the hive then flies out in a certain direction and 
distance, locating the food. In some sense, the bee communicates the information 
of the food supply to the hive.

What's philosophically interesting about this?

- How do we talk about what the bee is doing?
- Is the bee 'speaking a language'? Is the bee saying *that* 'food is located in 
  this direction'?
- Can't we explain why a particular bee on one occasion does that by invoking 
  the pattern that it's an instance of?
    - What would it mean to say of a bee returning from a food source that its 
      turnings and wiggling has occurred *because* they're part of a complete 
      dance?
    - This is related to distinction of pattern-governed vs rule-obeying 
      behavior [-@sellars1954some]. Ruth Milliken, Sellars' student, devotes her 
      career to this, developing the field of [teleosemantics](/docs/phil/definitions/teleosemantics.qmd) and writing about 
      it in [*Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories*](/docs/phil/people/millikan/works/language_other_biological/index.qmd)

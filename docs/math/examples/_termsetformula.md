- With respect to [the limit formula](/docs/math/propositions/limitformula.qmd), 
  if $\mathcal{J}=0$, then $n=0$; there are no vertices.
- There is exactly one empty tuple which vacuously satisfies the properties,
  so we've constructed the limit as the singleton set $\{()\}$ consisting of 
  just the empty tuple.
- Thus the limit of the empty diagram, i.e. the terminal object in **Set**, is 
  the singleton set.

- A database is a system of interlocking tables.
- Some columns are internal references (i.e. *foreign keys*), others are
   external references (string, int, etc.).
    - Changing the internal reference value doesn't mean anything (if we do it 
      consistently), but not for the external references.
- Category theory provides a mathmetical approach for translating between two 
  different database representations of a common domain.

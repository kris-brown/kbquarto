- This is a play on a famous Protagoras quote.
- Unfortunately, the opening qualification is important but usually left out.
- The qualification implies that there is more than just describing.
  - E.g. placing something in the 
    [space of reasons](/docs/phil/people/sellars/works/epm/space_of_reasons.qmd).

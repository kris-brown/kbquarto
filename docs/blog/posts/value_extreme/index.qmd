title: Value of extreme examples
draft: true
---

Sometimes extreme examples are not appropriate, e.g. when an 
emotionally-triggering example is used where an ordinary one would suffice. [^1]


[^1]: Furthermore, when you take an opponent's argument to unintended extremes, it 
can be easily miscontrued that you actually think the opponent holds the
extreme view (that you fail to have the basic social skill of recognizing that 
a lot of communication is *implicit*). 

But if you can avoid that miscontrual, then an extreme example can efficiently 
cut to the heart of matters by getting the opponent to be *more explicit*. For 
example there is an argument as to whether it is unethical for a company that 
makes a mini magnet toy (which has hundreds of tiny ball magnets) to report 
its injuries in terms of injuries per magnet (1 in 22 million) instead of 
1 injury per 100,000 sets.

Arguing against someone who says the first statistic is not inherently wrong, 
one could say "Is it wrong to report injuries per atom sold?" It would be 
cleaner to phrase this as "Why is it the case that you draw the line between 
injury per magnet and injury per atom?" to avoid a misconception[^1]. 

The fact that the atoms are inseparable from each other might be an explanation.
This could be pushed to be that the atoms all come at once together makes it 
deceptive to split them up for the purposes of the injury denominator. This can
inform the injury per set vs injury per magnet debate.

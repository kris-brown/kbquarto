[Kant](/docs/phil/people/kant) radicalized the distinction between:

- primary qualities (properties that are truly there)
- secondary qualities (properties that are due to us).

He challenges us to divide the labor:

- what features is the *world responsible for*?
- what features are *we responsible for*?
  - E.g. the fact our theories are expressed in German/English

This distinction lives in [Sellars](/docs/phil/people/sellars) as 
the difference between:

-  the world *in the narrow sense*
-  the world *in the wider sense*
    - E.g. which includes norms that are only accessible from a 
      participant's perspective.

Example from [Brandom writing about Sellars](/docs/phil/people/brandom/works/two_ply).

Pluto was first postulated in order to explain perturbations in the orbit of 
Neptune (by inference from Newton's laws). At that point, Pluto was a purely 
theoretical object. When we got more telescopes and could observe Pluto 
'directly'. Overnight, Pluto's status changed from theoretical object to 
observable object, but Pluto itself didn't change.

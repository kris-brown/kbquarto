[Empiricism](/docs/phil/Empiricism.html) and [naturalism](/docs/phil/Naturalism.html) are historically allied ideologies, but there are times which they conflict with each other.

Natural laws are something that we cannot empirically ground.

As programs of [Analytic philosophy](/docs/phil/Analytic philosophy.html), empiricism picks an epistemologically-privileged base vocabulary to explain problematic vocabularies, while naturalism picks an ontologically-privileged base vocabulary.

Of the two of these, by the time of the late 20th century empiricism was largely abandoned, while naturalism still has followers. This can be attributed to empiricism's close ties to [foundationalism in epistemology](/docs/phil/Foundationalism.html).

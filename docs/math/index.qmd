Math notes - this is very much in construction. Slowly copying over from the [old site](https://www.krisb.org/root/doc-2notes/math).

A reader (with no particular technical background) ought be able to drop into a random page and start reading. Although there may be jargon / required context, by following appropriate internal links it should become clear what the jargon means / what context is required. Then, the reader ought backtrack precisely as far as needed to make sense of the original page. If any page doesn't meet this standard, then it's something for me to fix.

- About 1% of the notes here meet this standard right now. It's hard work to upgrade what's initially jotted down here to that standard.
- Weeks/months later I'll re-read stuff that has been jotted down and do edits until I've made sense of them.

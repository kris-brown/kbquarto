Rorty characterized the followers of Sellars as being left or right wing 
depending on which 
passage was found to be more insightful/fundamental to 
Sellars' thought.

- Right-wing:
  - Passage: [scientium mensura](/docs/phil/people/sellars/works/epm/scientia.qmd) 
  - Examples: [Millikan](/docs/phil/people/millikan), Jay Rosenberg
- Left-wing:
  - Passage: [space of reasons](/docs/phil/people/sellars/works/epm/space_of_reasons.qmd)
  - Examples: Rorty, Brandom, MacDowell

Sellars saw both aspects of his philosophy as essential.

Rorty joked that he hoped that they would settle their differences more peacefully 
than the right and left wing Hegelians, who did so during a long conference 
called the Battle of Stalingrad.

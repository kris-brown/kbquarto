It is commonly reasoned that abstract or theoretical objects and concrete 
observable objects are simply different types of things. 

The example of [Pluto](/docs/phil/situations/pluto.qmd) makes it clear that what 
we really want to make is a distinction of how we *come to know* of something, 
rather than thinking about ontological different things.

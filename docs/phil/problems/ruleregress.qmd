title: Regress of rules
---


- To follow a rule (e.g. 'under circumstances $C$, do $A$', or 'Whenever you see a cat, raise your hand'), we have to understand the concepts that are involved within (i.e. $C$ or *cat*, or *raising one's hand*).
- However, to grasp a concept (such that the original rule can be followed) requires a further rule.
- Put another way, because rules have many interpretations, for any rule $R$ we need another rule which tells us whether or not we correctly applied $R$.
- If a law says 'Every man must serve in the army', then it will naturally require a law for determining who qualifies as 'man'. That law (say, 'A man is whatever the scientific experts label with the word *man*') will naturally require a law for determining who qualifies as 'scientific expert'... the regress will continue if we try to adjudicate 'scientific expert' with another rule.
- This skepticism about rules is really a skepticism about a certain theory of *meaning* (i.e. semantic skepticism).

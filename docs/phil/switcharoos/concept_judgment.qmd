# Overview 

We normally think that the content of judgments are dictated by the content of 
the concepts used inside of them. This feels especially right for artificial 
languages:

- Take "If it's a $P$, then it's a $Q$."
    - Or, logically: $\forall x, P(x)\implies Q(x)$
- The meaning of this statement seems to depend on what concepts $P$ and $Q$ we 
  substitute in. E.g. with $P \mapsto {\rm red\ thing},\  Q \mapsto {\rm colored\ thing}$, 
  it's a good a judgment, whereas $Q \mapsto {\rm rectangular\ thing}$ would no 
  longer be a good judgment.

However, [Kant](/docs/phil/people/kant/index.qmd) turned this around. 
In this view, judgments are prior (in the order of understanding) to concepts.

# The prior tradition 

Traditional logic up until Kant thought of 
everything in terms of classification. There were three levels:

1. Logic/semantics starts with concepts,
    - These are classified as particular or general
    - e.g. "red" (general), "colored" (general), "ball" (particular)
2. ...then built up a notion of judgments,
    - These are classified say when one judgment falls under another.
    - e.g. "the ball is red", "red is subsumed by colored"
3. ... then built up a doctrine of conquences of syllogisms.
    - These tell you what sorts of inferences you can make.
    - e.g. "If x is red, then x is colored".

Kant flipped the order $1\rightarrow 2$ to $2 \rightarrow 1$ (think of concepts 
as functions of judgment). Sellars then 
extended this to flip $2\rightarrow 3$ to $3\rightarrow 2$ (think of judgments 
as functions of the inferences we make).

# Sellars

We normally think of logically-valid inferences 
(e.g. $A \land B \implies B \lor C$) as something 
we understand *prior* to particular inferences (e.g. "If it's red and 
triangular, then it's triangular or heavy"). Sellars calls these particular 
inferences 
[material_inferences](/docs/phil/distinctions/made/material_inference.qmd) and 
argues that it is only through understanding *them* that we could understand 
logically-valid inferences.

One argument for our initial intuition is that the logically-valid inferences 
are *a priori*, whereas the particular inferences are *a posteriori*.[^1] 
However, [Achilles and the Tortoise](/docs/phil/problems/tortoise.qmd) 
articulates that, although the logically-valid inferences 
exist *a priori* as abstract mathematical/syntactical objects, without having any 
practical experience of actually making inferential moves we don't have access 
to them *qua* inferences.

[^1]: The words *priori* and *posteriori* literally make the order clear.

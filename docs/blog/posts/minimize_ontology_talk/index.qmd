This is essentially a rehash of various bits of Rorty that were floating in my 
head, sort of put into my own words.

Ontology (the theory of what really is, or the what is there 'objectively') 
makes conflict possible: e.g. without further auxillary hypotheses, there is no 
incompatibility between "Alice thinks there is a saber-toothed tiger coming" and 
"Bob thinks there is no such tiger coming." We can think of the *social 
function* of the whole concept of objectivity as serving this purpose.

Clearly it's useful in some situations, especially 'ordinary empirical 
descriptive' (OED) language ('the frog is on the log'). So, we would lose the 
ability to cope with the world in important ways if we were to adopt a 
thoroughgoing idealism.

However, outside of the 'home language-game' of OED vocabulary, do we really 
need it? Could it be causing *unnecessary* conflict when pulled outside of its 
original motivating context, such as the 
[tooth pain](/docs/phil/situations/toothpain.qmd) example?

For whatever sociohistorical reasons (which would be interesting to think 
about), objectivity-talk is incredibly pervasive. It takes serious work to 
unlearn it, to show one can coherently grapple with non-OED concepts without 
it. One example of this: we're primed to think of sentience as some objective 
phenomenon (because we're primed to be 
[descriptivists](/docs/phil/people/brandom/sellars09/4/index.qmd#semantic-nominalism)), 
but this is entirely unnecessary. We can completely sidestep talk of the 
ontological nature of sentience and get along perfectly fine. In fact, given a 
real world problem that depends on this issue (e.g. "Is this AI a sentient 
being?") it is a net positive because we can focus our attention on relevant 
things (our social practices relating to the AI, rather than some feature purely 
of the source code).

However, if you want *power* over others, couching your beliefs in objectivity 
talk is useful for gaining authority.

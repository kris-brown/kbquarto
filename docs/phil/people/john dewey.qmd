# Rorty on Dewey
Dewey wants the distinctions between science and philosophy to be rubbed out and 
replaced with an uncontroversial notion of intelligence trying to solve problems 
and provide meanings.

While this is a [distinction](/docs/phil/Objective and subjective facts.html) 
that Rorty, too, wishes to undermine, Rorty criticizes Dewey (in [Experience and Nature](/docs/phil/works/Experience and Nature.html)) as wanting to "use the term 'experience' as an incantatory device to blur every conceivable distinction."

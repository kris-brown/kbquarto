Consider the [symmetric monoidal preorder](/docs/math/defs/smp.qmd) 
$(\mathbb{R},\geq,0,+)$ which is the same as **Cost** but does not include 
$\infty$. How do you characterize the difference between this and a Lawvere 
metric space?

## Solution
It is a metric space in which points may only be finitely-far apart.

# Historical Kant Context

[Kant](/docs/phil/people/kant/index.qmd) was not in favor within 
[analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy) when 
Sellars began, due to Kant's connection to 
[Hegel](/docs/phil/people/brandom/#on-kant-and-hegel)[^1]. However, this is 
ironic because Kant is incredibly analytical and science-driven.

[^1]:Hegel was the 'Great Bad' of Anglophone philosophy

Three ideas of Kant that mattered to Sellars:

## Freedom
- Rousseau said "Obedience to a law that one has laid oneself is freedom."
- Kant turned this around to distinguish *constraint by norms* from *constraint 
  by power*.


## Normativity
Kant's *normative* understanding of discursive practice[^2]

[^2]: i.e. practice relating to *concepts*.

- How do we understand the difference between concept-using, sapient beings from 
  mere responders to the natural environment? Here are two possible ways to 
  think of it:
    - $O$: An *ontological* distintion: knowers are an actually different kind 
      of thing (perhaps there is a presence of 'mind stuff' or 'spirit stuff').
    - $D$: A *deontological* distinction: we *treat* knowers differently from 
      objects. There are things that the agents are in a distinctive sense 
      *responsible* for [^3].
- Both sides treat $D$ as true, but Team $O$ furthermore believes $O$ is true 
  and that the order of explanation is $O \implies D$. However, Team $D$ takes 
  $D$ as essential and needs not make any claim about ontology.

- Downstream of this are many of Kant's innovations.
    - The minimum unit of awareness/experience is the *judgment*
        - this comes from taking $D$ to be fundmental: it is the smallest thing 
          we can be held responsible for
        - Everything else (particular concepts like *Fido the dog*, universal 
          concepts like *triangularity*, logical concepts) has to be understood 
          in terms of the function it plays with respect to judgment.
    - The *subjective* form of judgment (the "I think..." that can accompany all 
      judgments)
        - Because it can accompany all representations, this is the emptiest 
          form of judgment.
        - The mark of "who is responsible for the judgment".
        - To say "*I think* it is raining now." is to emphasize that *I* am 
          responsible (e.g. subject to criticism if you go outside and don't 
          get wet).
    - The *objective* form of judgment (the "$x$ is ..." or "$x$ = ..." for some 
      object $x$).
        - Mark of what you've made yourself responsible to.
        - When saying "That stone is 50 pounds.", the stone has a certain 
          authority over me (one looks to the stone to see whether I am right or 
          wrong; it sets the standards of correctness). See the 
          [shopping list scenario](/docs/phil/situations/shoppinglist.qmd).

[^3]: This point is shared by the later Wittgenstein. The 
[puzzles](/docs/phil/situations/childrensgame.qmd) that Wittgenstein offers us 
(along the way to trying to dissolve the presuppositions that make it puzzling) 
center around the normative significance of beliefs/desires/intentions.

## Concepts
- In addition to concepts whose principle expressive job is to describe/explain 
  empirical goings-on, there are concepts whose principle expressive job it is 
  to make explicit the framework that makes description possible.
    - These are known *a priori* framework-explicating concepts.
    - This is Kant's response to Hume, for how we can understand the modal force 
      of laws in virtue of their non-modal description.
        - The answer is in the description framework itself.
        - The fact that there are necessarily relations that concepts have among 
          another makes description possible (a concept being contentful at all 
          requires it to have some necessary relations to other concepts).
- What Sellars means by 'ushering philosphy from its Humean phase to its Kantian 
  phase' is putting categories front and center.
    - Trying to *describe* the modal structure of the world or describe the 
      space of possible worlds is to try to assimilate modal language into 
      descriptivism, rather than seeing them as playing a different expressive 
      role
    - Sellars saw Kant as putting this other option on the table.

## More ideas
- A difference between Humean thinking and Kantian thinking: for Kant, laws of 
  nature are not 'super-facts' - they are not 'describing the world'. Rather, 
  they make explicit a rule of inference.

- Another Kantian idea: the distinction between *phenomena* and *noumena*:
    - Kant radicalized the distinction between:
        - primary qualities (properties that are truly there)
        - secondary qualities (properties that are due to us).
    - He challenges us to divide the labor:
       - what features is the *world responsible for*?
       - what features are *we responsible for*?
           - E.g. the fact our theories are expressed in German/English
    - This distinction lives in Sellars as the difference between:
        -  the world *in the narrow sense*
        -  the world *in the wider sense*
            - E.g. which includes norms that are only accessible from a 
              participant's perspective.

# Sellars quotes

The lecture finishes with some 
[Sellars quotes](/docs/phil/people/sellars/index.qmd#quotes) on describing, 
explaining, and justifying.

He doesn't begin with philosophically elaborated definition of describing, 
explaining, justifying. He takes these concepts as they come. He wants to do 
philosophy in a neutral / as close-to-practice way as possible.

-  There exists a category **PrO** which has preorders as objects and 
   [monotone maps](/docs/math/defs/monotone_map.qmd) as morphisms.
- There exists a category *Bool-Cat* in which the objects are 
  **Bool**-categories and morphisms are **Bool**-functors.
- We call these categories equivalent because there exist [functors](/docs/math/defs/functor.qmd) 
  $\mathbf{PrO}\overset{F}{\underset{G}{\rightleftarrows}}\mathbf{BoolCat}$ such 
  that there exist [natural isomorphisms](/docs/math/defs/natural_transformation.qmd) $F;G \cong id_\mathbf{PrO}$ 
  and $G;F \cong id_\mathbf{Bool-Cat}$

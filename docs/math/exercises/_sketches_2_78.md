Consider $\mathbb{R}$ as a 
[Lawvere metric space](/docs/math/defs/lawvere_metric_space.qmd), i.e. as 
a **Cost**-category.
- Form the **Cost**-product $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$.
- What is the distance from $(5,6)$ to $(-1,4)$?

## Solution
The distance is the Manhattan/$L_1$ distance: $|5-(-1)| + |6-4| = 8$

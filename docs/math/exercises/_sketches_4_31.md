Prove that the serial 
[composition of profunctors](/docs/math/defs/vprof_comp.qmd), 
$\mathcal{X}\overset{\phi}\nrightarrow\mathcal{Y}$ and 
$\mathcal{Y}\overset{\psi}\nrightarrow\mathcal{Z}$, 
is associative.

## Solution
This is tantamount to 
[quantale matrix multiplication](/docs/math/defs/quantale_matrix.qmd) 
being associative, which was shown in 
[Exercise 2.104](/docs/math/exercises/sketches_2_104.qmd).

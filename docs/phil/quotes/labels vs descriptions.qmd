[Author](/docs/phil/people/Wilfrid Sellars.html)

> It's only because the expressions in terms of which we describe
objects, locate those objects in a space of implications that they describe it
all rather than merely label.

—  [Counterfactuals, Dispositions, and the Causal Modalities](/docs/phil/works/Counterfactuals, Dispositions, and the Causal Modalities.html) §108

- Describing is what science is the measure of all things. But it's more than 
  classifying things.
- Sellars is raising the issue "what is description?"

Sellars says "concepts as classifiers" is [not enough](/docs/phil/interaction/Concepts and judgment.html) to get to descriptions.

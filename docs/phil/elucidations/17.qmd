# Action at a distance
- Action at a distance
  - E.g. Gravity/EM, something in one place can affect something far away 
    without anything passing in between

## Example
  -  Trying to explain how a magic trick (making a match levitate) works.
    1. The magician has the power to make things levitate with their mind
      - This would be disturbing because it can't be generalized / doesn't fit 
        into a universal scientific model
    2. The magician has magnets in the walls and controls them with a small 
       computer
      - Would alleviate the disturbance.
    3. The magician can send out 'levitator particles' from the eyes. There's a 
       'levitator particle' detector which is triggered, shows they have energy 
       and can do work.
      - Would also alleviate the concern, the particles would become the new 
        normal, a feature of the world.
  - Action at a distance would be like having no such explanation (though there 
    is regularity/predictability).

# Consequence of action at a distance
- Fear: if we allow action at a distance, then anything is permitted anywhere
  - Billiard ball motion could be determined by huge (far away) bodies of motion 
    rather than anything local.
- in 17th century, "mechanistic philosophy" (e.g. Boyle)
  - All explanations should be given by just matter and motion
  - Magnets thought to emit something similar to levitator particles
- in 19th century, get the development of a field.
  - Newton's gravity is action at a distance is already well-established
    - action at a distance now tolerated widely
  - Faraday/Maxwell are able to reform E&M that doesn't require action at a 
    distance, have nothing to say about gravity.
  - Einstein then gets rid of it for gravity
  
# Quantum mechanics reintroduced action at a distance
- Einstein has methodological complaint. Science is impossible if objects aren't 
  independent of each other.
- Leibniz Principle of Sufficient Reason: for everything that happens, there is 
  a reason why it (in particular) happened.
- Paramenides: nothing comes from nothing (apple comes from the tree, apple's 
  redness came from the seed (DNA))
    - Change is impossible follows from this
    - In some sense, something coming from nothing would violate the principle 
      of sufficient reason.

# Prior
- Many arguments for and against.
- Philosophically, one must have a framework to do science.
- P.S.R. is really hard to do without.
- There were never historically people who lamented loss of action at a distance when an equally predictive theory becomes available.

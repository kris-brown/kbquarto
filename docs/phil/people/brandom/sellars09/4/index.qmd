Uses Principia Mathematica notation which takes some time to learn.

Goodman has let the formalism of classical extensional logic mislead him in thinking about counterfactuals. He thought we could build up to counterfactuals from extensional logical vocabulary. The kind that can be built up by extensional logical vocabulary Sellars calls subjunctive identicals.

Goodman is impressed in Fact fiction and Forecast, with the difference between the claim `All copper melts at 1084 °C' and `all the coins in my pocket are copper'. The first supports counterfactual reasoning (``if this coin in my pocket \emph{were} copper, it'd melt at 1084 °C") whereas if this nickel coin were in my pocket, it wouldn't be made of copper. However we can do some limited form of counterfactual reasoning: ``if I pulled a coin out of my pocket, it would be copper''. We can always rephrase such counterfactuals (accidental generalizations) as a statement about something identical to an actual object. (The distinction is less sharp between genuine counterfactuals and subjunctive identicals is less sharp than he thinks, according to Brandom)

Makes [subjunctive vs counterfactual distinction](/docs/phil/distinctions/made/subjunctive_counterfactual.qmd).

Defines a \ref{dispositions|disposition|source}.


# Dispositions
Sellars' formalization of a disposition:

1. A kind term
    - More than a mere predicate: in addition to criteria of application, also have criteria of identity and individuation.
    - Two flavors: proper individuating terms as well as mass terms (which requires something like 'cup of' to individuate)
2. Condition term
3. Intervention term
4. Result term

Canonical example: ``If you put the sugar in water, it will dissolve.''

Distinct from a capacity claim: ``Sugar has the capacity to dissolve" is a claim that there exists a condition and intervention such that the result obtain.

# Casual modalities
Sellars first big idea: what was needed was a functional theory of concepts (especially alethic/normative modalities), which would make their role in reasoning, rather than their supposed origin and experience their primary feature. Sellars takes modal expressions to be inference licenses.


Jerry Fodor's theory of semantic content in terms of nomological locking: can't directly say anything about modality directly. Not alone: Dretske and other teleosemantic literature. Sellars wants to argue this program will never work.

An axial idea of \ref{kant|Kant|An axial idea of Kant}: the framework that makes description possible has features which we can express with words (words whose job is not to describe\footnote{in the narrow sense} anything, but rather to make explicit features of the framework within which we can describe things).

The framework is often characterized with laws. With alethic modal vocabulary on the object side, normative vocabulary on the subject side.

\ref{kant|Kant|What Kant is concerned with} is concerned with features that are necessary conditions of the possibility of applying descriptive contents. How are statements like that sensibly thought of as true or false? (where the home language game is ordinary descriptive language) Kant says yes, in a sense, but have to be careful. If these kinds of claims are knowledge, what kind of justification is involved in it? Can we think of them as expressing even a kind of empirical knowledge? (after all, we learned laws of nature empirically, it seems). We have to think about the relationship between the framework and what you can say, in the framework, and what you can say about the framework. Kant was the first one worried about all that stuff. Sellars wants to find a meta framework for talking about the relations between talk within that framework of description, and talk about that framework of description.


# From labels to descriptions
\ref{semantic_nominalism|Semantic nominalism|related to Sellars} was universally held until Kant. (philosophy today hasn't yet graduated from its Humean to its Kantian phase)

If you could argue that standing in counterfactually, robust inferential relations to other descriptive terms, was an essential feature of the descriptive content of a concept (and you could argue that modal vocabularies had the expressive job of making those explicit), then you'd be in a position to argue for the Kant-Sellars thesis about modality. That would be to say that the expressive job of modal vocabulary is to make explicit the inferential relations between descriptive concepts (these are invisible to the empiricist).

Fork in road: Hume+Quine, or Kant+Sellars.

Labels are not descriptions. There's more to describing than labeling.

Consider mere labels. Elements on a tray have red or blue dots. Have they been described? If so, what have they been described as? If we add things to the tray, we don't know whether they deserve red or blue labels. At the very least, descriptions need a practice for applying to new cases. We can throw that in but still not have a description.

Suppose I'm trying to give you the concept of gleeb. I give you an infalliable gleebness tester. Do you have a description?

Sellars: ``It's only because the expressions in terms of which we describe objects, locate those objects in a space of implications that they describe it all rather than merely label.''

This is what a mere classifier have.

What's the difference between me and a parrot who has been trained to say `red' when presented a red object. The parrot isn't describing, but I am because my noise is situated in a space of implications: something follows for me from classifying that thing is red (that it's colored that it's spatially extended, that if it's a Macintosh Apple, it's right). And furthermore, other things can be evidence for the claim that it Scarlet is evidence for it or that it's a right Macintosh, Apple is evidence for it. And it excludes other classifications. That monochromatic patch is not green, if it's red, and so on.

The classifier focuses only on the \emph{circumstances} of application, not the \emph{consequences} of application. A way to answer what the red and blue dots describe an element \emph{as} is to say what follows from something having a blue or red dot (e.g. things labelled red are to be discarded). Now we have some descriptive content associated with the label.

Verificationism / classical american pragmatism focused purely on the \emph{consequences} of application.

To say we need both circumstances and consequences is to say that the inferences the concept plays into is an essential part of a concept.

If the only inferences we could make were truth functional relations, then a gleeb detector like thing could be sufficient to capture the concept of gleeb fully; however, we care about counterfactually robust inferences.

You can't count as understanding (i.e. grasp the meaning of) any descriptive expression / concept, unless you distinguish at least some of the inferences that it's involved (i.e. some of the connections within that space of implications) as counterfactually robust (i.e. ones that would still obtain, even if something that is true wasn't, or something that isn't true was). The claim is not that there are particular counterfactual inferences you need, but that you need at least \emph{some} to have the concept.

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item Chestnut trees produce chestnuts
\begin{itemize}
\item Unless they're immature / blighted
\item Whether or not it's raining on them now wouldn't affect the fact that chestnut trees produce chestnuts
\end{itemize}
\item Dry, well-made matches light if you strike them
\begin{itemize}
\item Not if there's not enough oxygen
\item The position of a distant beetle on a tree that doesn't affect whether this match lights
\end{itemize}
\item The hungry lioness would chase the nearby Gazelle
\begin{itemize}
\item Not if it were struck by lightning
\item But it would, whether or not the hyena were watching it
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Q: do we have to have overlap in our distinctions we made to communicate about the same concept?
A: The conceptual content itself is a norm that settles which inferences are correct and which are incorrect. Then, you and I may have different views about where that line is drawn. And what makes it possible for us to communicate (to agree or to disagree) is that we've bound ourselves by the same norm by using the same word. You may think the melting point of copper is different from what I think it is. But we can still be disagreeing about copper because there's a fact of the matter about what you're committed to, on that issue, when you use the word `copper'.

Q: Is this a counter-example? You are asked to bring a thing to your lab (it just landed from an alien planet - you can't make any inferences about it).
A: It's complicated. Firstly, `thing' or `object' is not a sortal - you can't count them (they're pro-sortals, placeholders for sortals). If we supply one (e.g. place-occupying piece of mass - which would suffice give us some counterfactually robust inferences). If you don't supply one, you haven't thought about it. Related to Wittgenstein's \ref{point_plate|plate example|related to Sellars}.

\ref{kant|Kant|mentioned} says concepts are rules for judgment we \ref{brandomconcept|bind ourselves by|Explaining Kant}. That doesn't settle the question of how much of the law we need to know in order to bind ourselves by it. I don't have to know much about molybdenum to refer to molybdenum.





# Semantic nominalism
Semantic paradigm is the ``name-bearer'' relationship. E.g. the `Fido'-Fido relation, between the name `Fido' and the dog, Fido. Predicates/properties are just names that stick to the set.

If we stick together labels, we get descriptions (not a primitive name bearer relation, but one we can understand in terms of name-bearer relations). That's what language lets us do. Describe/classify things (as falling under languages).

Sellars calls this \emph{descriptivism}: what you do with language is describe things.

You find this not only in anglophone tradition but also in a pure form in Hussurl / semiotics. Derrida rejects Hussurl because there are some phenomena that can't be related by sign-signified relations, but he addresses it by saying it's all signs.

Kant found sentences special: you don't describe things with them, you say things with them. Theory of judgment. The Tractatus has no room for statements of natural law. For normative statements, it retreats into mysticism.

Semantic nominalism is atomistic - the relation of a name and its bearer doesn't turn on anything else.



# Kant-Sellars thesis

{{< include kant_sellars.qmd >}}

# Modal revolution in the 20th century
Revolution in Anglophone philosophy, taking three phases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Kripke's possible-worlds semantics for modal logic (algebraic properties accessibility relation determine which modal system we're in) \begin{enumerate}
        \item Quine was a skeptic of modal talk, said that we didn't know what we really meant when talking about it.
        \item His concerns became unpopular with this development, as Kripke's semantics gave people the impression that we had a grasp on what we meant (in fact, alethic modal talk became the philosophical ground level for explaining other puzzling things (such as intentionality)).
        \item  Quine thinks his objection is not yet satisfied; of course we can explain modal concepts in terms of other modal concepts - what do we mean by \emph{possible world}? What do we mean by \emph{accessibility}?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The previous development is only for modal logic, but Montague, David Kaplan, David Lewis, Stalnaker, etc. extended it to work for non-logical semantics as well. For example: \begin{itemize}
        \item In Lewis' \textit{General Semantics} \cite{lewis1976general}, if we decide to treat objects as semantic interpretant of our names, sets of possible worlds as the semantic interpretant of our sentences, then one-place predicates correspond to functions from objects to sets of possible worlds.
        \item `walks' is a function from objects to the worlds in which that object is walking.
        \item adverbs, like `slowly', is a function from one-place predicates to one-place predicates.
        \item This apparatus gives us a way to talk precisely about certain distinctions that come up in philosophy language. E.g. adverbs come in two flavors: \begin{itemize}
            \item Attributive: `walked \emph{slowly}' which implies one walked at all
            \item Non-attributive: `walked \emph{in one's imagination}'
    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Kripke's \textit{Naming and Necessity} \cite{kripke1972naming} \begin{itemize}
    \item Introduced us to contingent \textit{a priori} and metaphysical necessity
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Brandom says: the second is the most important, but Quine's objection was not addressed by Kripke's semantics nor the fact that it's useful in semantics to be able to use Kripke's apparatus. The reason why we should have gained comfortablity with alethic modal language is actually the \ref{kant_sellars|Kant-Sellars thesis|relevance}, which dispels empiricist worries of modal concepts being unintelligible.

But hardly anyone knows about that argument. If they did, it would color our current focuses and interests. For the Kant-Sellars thesis pertains to causal/physical modalities. But nowadays, the center of philosophical thought worries about logical modalities and metaphysical modalities - causal modality is boring to them. ``We're distracted by the shiny, new playground that Kripke offered us and lost sight of the modality that's philosophically most significant."

# Debate between Mr C and Mr E
\begin{table}[]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Name & Mr C &  Mr E\\ \hline
Stands for & constant conjunction & entailment \\ \hline
Represents & empiricists &  rationalists\\ \hline
Core of truth &  statements of necessary connection do not describe matter of factual states of affairs & what you're \emph{doing} when you make a modal claim is endorsing the propriety of a pattern of material inference \\ \hline
Core mistake & the only thing you can do with language is describe matter of factual states of affairs (therefore, laws must be descriptions of regularities) & statements of necessity describe entailment (still a descriptivist POV) \\ \hline
%&  &  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{}
\label{tab:mrdebate}
\end{table}

Sellars take the dialectic through many turns instead of just saying what he thinks. He pretends to be even-handed until deciding to focus on tweaking Mr E.'s theory to make it work.

Need to distinguish four related types of claims:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The practical endorsement of infering that things are $B$'s from their being $A$'s. \begin{itemize}
\item This is presupposed by the act of describing (Kant-Sellars thesis)
\end{itemize}
\item The explicit statement that one may infer the applicability of $B$ from the applicability of $A$ \begin{itemize}
\item This can be asserted without understanding the expressions $A$ and $B$
\item I.e., it's syntactic; just a statement about the use of language
\item Someone who doesn't speak German can still say ``If $x$ is `rot', then $x$ is `farbig'."
\end{itemize}
\item The statement that $A$ physically entails $B$
\item The statement that $A$'s are necessarily $B$'s.
\end{enumerate}

Mr E was getting the \emph{content} of modal statements wrong; they aren't \emph{about} language.

That some inference is ok is something that is \emph{conveyed} by a modal claim, but it is not what is \emph{said}. (Analogy: John \emph{says/asserts/means} ``The weather is good today'', but John \emph{conveys} ``John thinks the weather is good today'' and John \emph{does not say} ``John thinks the weather is good today.''). Related to this \ref{modalities_norms|quote|referenced}.


What Sellars' conclusion ought to be: what one is \emph{doing} in making a modal assertion is endorsing a pattern of material inference. No need to take a stand on semantics. This is an expressivist view of modal vocabulary. Analogous to expressivism in ethics: what you are \emph{doing} in saying someone ought to do $X$ is endorsing doing $X$. We can try to understand the semantic/descriptive content\footnote{We cannot deny there is any descriptive content due to \ref{frege_geach|Frege-Geach argument|related to Sellars}} in terms of what one is \emph{doing} when we use the expressions.

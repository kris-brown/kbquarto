- What is altruism
  - "pure altruism" Help to someone else at some cost to self
  - (distinct from reciprocal altruism: done with expectation of return)
- Is the tendency to behave altrusitically was evolved?
  - Other animals act in benefit for kin
    - E.g. bird lures predator away from nest to protect her offspring
    - We have genetic disposition to protect our genes (even if not done on 
      conscious level)
  - Human altruism is also an effect that is amplified for kin
    - We have urge to protect an unknown child
      - Perhaps we are just pattern matching (consciously or unconsciously) off 
        of our altruism for offspring.
    - You see a burning building and a person inside it
      - It's your daughter - you rush in without thinking (and societally judged 
        as moral behavior)
      - It's your neighbor - you call the fire department (societally judged as 
        moral behavior)
      - This is very distinct from \ref{kant|Kantian|} moral behavior which 
        would judge the scenarios as roughly equal.
        - (this is not a good model of how we actually behave)
    - Evidence that this behavior can be explained via evolution
      - Humans are evolved animals and thus behavior can often be successfully 
        explained via evolutionary biology (human moral behavior no different 
        in this regard)
  - However, altruistic behavior seems to be taught. Would this mean it's not 
    evolutionary?
    - There's a learning component (like language, but we would never use the 
      fact that it's learned to argue that the capacity / faculty for it isn't 
      innate)
    - After all, different cultures have different moral systems
      - But there is extraordinary similarity among all cultures, indictative as 
        a common starting point
        - E.g. Act to help your own kin
        - Similar to facial expressions corresponding to certain motions being 
          similar across different cultures
    - The moral "grammar" is there from evolution but we have to learn the 
      semantics of that grammar and how to apply the rules.
      - Example of what concretely do we have to learn to be altruistic?
        - We have to learn who are our kin?
        - We have to learn what is helpful vs harmful (e.g. that the doctor 
          sticking needles in is not harming your child)
        - We have to learn to share as children (but children learn this 
          remarkably easily)
  - Can human ethical behavior be justified by the fact it was evolved?
    - No. Actual human norms for moral discourse/justification are needed to 
      justify actions morally
      - To say "I shot the intruder because I evolved to act that way" would 
        not be a socially acceptable justification
    - Evolutionary theory is used to explain what those norms are. (E.g. "why 
      is it that 'I was doing it to be altruistic' is successful in justifying 
      behavior to other humans?)
  - Are morals all contingent based on the influence of evolution (rather than 
    coming from pure reason)
    - "It's just the type of people we are"
      - Used to justify thinking of the world in causal terms (Kant says we 
        simply are not capable of doing otherwise)
        - Evolutionary biology gives explanation (ancestors who didn't think 
          tigers were causally connected would get eaten)
      - Likewise for altruism as a first principle, it can be justified by this 
        line
        - Evolutionary theory provides further explanation of why that's the 
          case, arguments for how it increased fitness + heritability.
    - It's not contingent if it is who we are / we have a certain nature
  - How to respond of general criticism of evolutionary psychology as not 
    rigorous/testible?
    - In any scientific domain there will be theories that are adequately 
      justified or not
    - Justified empirical support for things in the domain of evolutionary 
      psychology
      - Instinctive behavior can be inherited
        - Ducks have instictive mating dances, breed ducks and get hybrid 
          dances (no one teaching)
      - Developmental studies
        - Sequence of things learned are constant (e.g. in language we learn 
          simple nouns first, then add X, Y, forming complex sentences, etc.
  - As a species we do well at altruism in small groups and get worse and worse 
    as our groups which are large
    - That's who we are. Should we go 'beyond' how we evolved to be better?
    - Treating kin well and more distant things worse is a constant from who we 
      are.
    - We severely mistreat others when we treat the other tribal group as "the 
      other"/"not us"/inhuman.
    - We become better behaved when we use our cultural knowledge / rational 
      faculties to see that the other tribe isn't so different from us after 
      all.

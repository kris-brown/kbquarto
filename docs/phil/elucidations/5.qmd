What is interesting about perception for philosophers (distinct from 
biologists/neuroscientists)?
    - Perception has necessary role within analysis of certain concepts

# Philophers need not come up with a theory of perception
- Empirical facts about perception may be useful, and the physical theories of 
  perception need not be challenged
    - E.g. gestalt psychology could be important to phenomonology
    - Notion of 'perceptual features'. Empirical question:
    - Is it that to perceive is, essentially, to perceive objects? Every 
      perception is a perception of something?
        -  alternatively, we could also perceive 'features', too
        - More generally, is perception uniform or is there a 
          richness/complexity of kind in the types of perception? This could 
          influence philosophers who need to discuss the uses of perception.
    - In some sense, this is just a boring/trivial question about the grammar of 
      perception.
    - Interesting empirical question: what is the privileged form of perceputal 
      sensations - how far are we (always) breaking down sense data into 
      objects? What physical mechanism does this?

# What should philosophers do
  - Philosophy should disentangle confusions that arise out of the natural usage 
    of the term.
    - An enduring example confusion:
      - Tendancy to approach problems in perception from a theory of knowledge.
        - How much do we know given our perceptions?
        - How does the knowledge from perceptions interact with other sources of 
          knowledge?
      - This is often a confusion
        - (though may make sense in certain contexts, e.g. wondering if I've 
          seen you before in the street)
      - It makes us wrongly think of the essence of perception as being in 
        contact / direct relation with the world, as a means of getting 
        knowledge.
      -  This is a category error
        - Epistemologists are not actually dealing with perception, rather 
          something derived from perception

# Local error
- Seeing something far away might be misleading
- Two people could perceive the same phenomenon differently for various reasons
- It's a mistake of philosophers to lift this to questioning perception in 
  general, questioning whether we ever could be in contact with the real world.





# 5 Contact with the outside world
  - Raw data (waves/beams) impinge upon us, our minds make sense of this
    - Optics / biology outside domain of philosophy.
    - Then philosophy asks the trancendental question "how is it possible for us 
      to access the outside world?"
      - From what point of view is this question being asked?
      - "Contact" is a better word than "access" because the fact that we (in 
        the world) are in contact with the world is obvious and nullifies the 
        philosophical question.
      - This question is a symptom of philosophy since Descartes, implies one 
        has already gone astray from understanding what perception is.
        - Benoist would respond to a Cartesian skeptic differently; rather, 
          would reject the question as ill-founded because the fact we are in 
          contact with the world is presupposed before asking more 
          abstract/higher order questions.
        - The fact that Descartes creates this artificial question leads him to 
          the artificial separation of the physical and spiritual world. Both 
          artificialities are related.
      - It's fundamental to perception that it's not possible to 'take distance' 
        from perception
        - (yes, epistemlogically, but that is really treating the uses of 
          perceptions).
        - It's legitimate inquiry into the role of perception among other 
          aspects of reasoning, but it is not about perception itself.

# Making sense of disagreement
  - How does belief in raw contact with the world explain different observers 
    observing the same thing differently?
    - E.g. "jaundiced eye" seeing the world with yellow tint
    - Benoist: perception is clearly dependent on where you are
    - The fact it is perspectival does not take away from the fact we are in 
      direct contact
    - However we also have different faculties which cause differences beyond 
      geometry (diseases, enhancements).
      - The yellow of jaundiced eye is just as much a reality and fact of 
        perception as seeing a stick broken in the water.
        - There is a temptation to think when our perspective has dramatically 
          affected the experience of some aspect of reality (stick), that it's 
          no longer the stick which we are perceiving
        - (even though it is the stick, even if it looks different than how 
          we're used to it - it's just the reality of optics that viewed a 
          certain way the experience of a stick is broken)
        - JL Austin: does anyone expect a stick, if it's actually straight, has 
          to appear to be straight under all circumstances?
      - It is wrong of philosophers to conclude from examples like this that our 
        subjectivity is in between us and contact with reality.
        - Our subjectivity is just us being ourselves as we are in relation to 
          the reality.
        - Subjectivity just captures the factors of perception which are 
          dependent on the perceiver's location/faculties
        - Subjectivity is just one aspect of the reality of perception (direct 
          contact with the world).

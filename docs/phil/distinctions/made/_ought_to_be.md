- A distinction fundamental for both 'must' in the alethic and doxastic modal senses.

- Sellars: You can't understand either of these kinds of oughts without understanding both. In particular, if you try to do everything with ought-to-do's:
    - One would fall into a kind of Cartesianism: we'd need to think of linguistic episodes as essentially the sort of thing brought about by an agent whose conceptualizing is not linguistic.
    - We'd be precluded from explaining what it means to have concepts in terms of the rules of the language. Ought to do's have the form of "in circumstances $C$, do $A$'' - what language are $C$ and $A$ stated in? Regress of rules without ought-to-be's.


- This is important because natural way to think of rules is exlusively in terms of Ought to Do (Sellars himself advocated this earlier: "A rule is always a rule for doing something"[-@sellars1954some]).

- There is also an analogous distinction involving permission, rather than obligation.



## Upshots
This lets us avoid the [rule obeying regress](/docs/phil/problems/ruleregress.qmd).

This distinction also can be used to avoid paradoxes of "ought" for things we don't have control over, e.g. I ought to believe such-and-such but I do not have control over my beliefs. Only ought-to-do's presuppose that one has agency to conform, while ought-to-be's do not. [-@chrisman2008ought]

- Some problems stem from representating a human state of mind as a static 
  object, whereas our beliefs aren't constant w/r/t time spent in reflection.
  - Every desire can be chained iteratively until you reach "the good", but 
    almost never is that entire chain 'in register' for real human being. At 
    instant $t$ in time, we are cognizant of a finite number of steps along 
    that chain (we implicitly accept some goals as final, even with more 
    thought power we would view them as instrumental).
  - Therefore the eliminitivist is not susceptible to Collard's criticism. 
    Whether the man's desire was satisfied would be dependent on his mental 
    state while having the desire. If he did not invest enough effort into 
    chaining the desire all the way to The Good, then it's possible for the 
    desire to be satisfied but the person not (and more likely the fewer links 
    along the chain are 'in register').
- Collard's "object"/"aim" structure of a desire seems to be just considering 
  two points along the chain - this is still more nuance than a one-point 
  approximation, but it really is referring to a pair "naive desires" as a 
  desire with bipartite structure.
  - It is a reasonable strategy to salvage the "separatist" POV by giving an
    account for the relation between different desired states of the world 
    (they are not atomic anymore)

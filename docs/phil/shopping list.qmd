From [-@anscombe2000intention]

A man has arrived at the grocery store to go shopping, but realizes he's forgotten his shopping list. Unbenknownst to him, a spy is following him, tasked with writing a list of everything that is put into the grocery cart. There are now two lists of groceries that have dual relationships to what is put into the cart:

| | The original shopping list | The spy's list |
|:--:|:---:|:----:|
| Relevant to determining correctness of an item being in the cart | Yes | No |
| Status of shopping cart relevant to correctness of an item being on the list| No | Yes |
| Authority structure | This has *authority* over what is put into the cart | The cart has *authority* over this |

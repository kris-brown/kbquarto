## Slogans
### Concepts
> It's not about our grip on concepts[^1]; it's about the concept's grip on us.

- this could also go in [Switcharoos](/docs/phil/switcharoos/index.qmd)

[^1]: this characterizes the pre-Kantian tradition

### On Kant and Hegel
> One cannot open the door enough for Kant to get through while being able to 
slam it shut before Hegel gets through. (Hegel was too interesting of a reader
of Kant)

### Sapience
> It's not what's between your ears, it's what's between you and your peers.

## Jokes
### On Gil Harmon
My teacher Gil Harmon said you should never really read anything that was 
written more than five years ago because, if it was important, people would 
have written about it. My classmates thought at the time that Gil was the 
*non plus ultra* of an ahistorical philosopher, but came to realize they were 
wrong. He was steeped in the history of philosophy - everything he did came out 
of his understanding of it ... it's just that he thought it started with Quine.

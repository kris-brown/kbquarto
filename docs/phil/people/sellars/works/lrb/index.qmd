## Rules are lived

> A rule, properly speaking, isn't a rule unless it lives in behavior,
rule-regulated behavior. Even rule-violating behavior. Linguistically we always
operate within a framework of living rules. To talk *about* rules is to
move outside the talked about rules into another framework of living rules. The
snake which sheds its skin lives within another. In attempting to grasp rules as
rules from without, we are trying to have our cake and eat it. To describe rules
is to describe the skeletons of rules. The rule is lived, not described.

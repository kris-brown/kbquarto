# Rorty's basic idea
## Neokantianism vs a socialized/historicized/naturalized alternative

- Struggle between two camps in the 19th century, which is then re-enacted in 
  the 20th century
  - Neokantianism (Marburg / Freiburg to CI Lewis and Carnap). Philosophy has 
    sovereign authority.
    - Idea originates with [Plato](/docs/phil/people/plato/index.qmd), but 
      Descartes/Kant/representationalism are 
      modern versions.
  - Neohegelianism ([Hegel](/docs/phil/people/hegel/index.qmd) socialized 
    philosophy, Marx naturalized it). 
    Philosophy brought 'down to Earth'.
- [Bertrand Russell](/docs/phil/people/russell/index.qmd) and 
  [Husserl](/docs/phil/people/hussurl/index.qmd) found things for 
  philosophy to be apodictic 
  about. Basis of Rorty's 'astonishing' claim that analytic philosophy is just a 
  phase of neokantianism
  - Russell and those downstream don't think of themselves this way.
  - But they share the idea that philosophy of language is "first philosophy" 
    and that linguistically-inflected philosophy of mind could advance our 
    notions of epistemology and general theory of representation.
  - Shared emphasis on understanding language semantically, distinct from 
    understanding knowledge epistemologically.
  - Husserl subject to Sellars' critique of the 
    [Myth of the Given](/docs/phil/people/sellars/myth.qmd), 
    [Russell](/docs/phil/people/russell/index.qmd) 
    subject to [Quine](/docs/phil/people/quine/index.qmd)'s critique of the
    [Myth of the Museum](/docs/phil/people/quine/myth.qmd). 
    ([Carnap](/docs/phil/people/carnap/index.qmd) is subject to both myths).
    - These are both (semantic) holist arguments.
- Rorty regards the pragmatist/holist Quine+Sellars rebuttals as bringing us 
  back to [Dewey](/docs/phil/people/dewey/index.qmd)'s 
  socialized/historicized/naturalized philosophy, with the 20th 
  century being a pointless, big detour (despite increase in technical advances 
  in logic/language).

## Assimilation of two kinds of representations
- Two kinds of privileged representations: sense impressions and representings 
  of meaning (meanings thought representationally instead of functionally)

- Rorty sees common genus to analytic meaning-articulating claims and the 
  sensory given: privileged representations
- common origin: role as infinite regress stoppers for the two types of 
  representations, sensuous intuitions and inference-licensing concepts, that 
  Kant distinguished (which each have these relations of privilege/authority).
  - [Agrippan trilema](/docs/phil/problems/agrippan.qmd) of alternatives to 
    skepticism
    - justification always in reference to other claims which require 
      justification (this can be circular or 
      [infinite regress](/docs/phil/problems/ruleregress.qmd)) 
      OR there are unjustified justifiers / foundations.
    - If we have foundations, we need two kinds of regress stoppers:
      - premises that have authority
      - inferential transitions that have authority
        - These are not the same as premises, c.f. 
          [Tortoise and the Hare](/docs/phil/problems/tortoise.qmd)
- That the "privileged representations" are authoritative and immediate, a kind 
  of atomism follows from their privilege.
  - In order to play their epistemically-privileged roles, the regress stoppers 
    must be semantically-privileged insofar as not depending on any collateral 
    epistemic commitments.
  - Quine and Sellars' critiques render such semantic privilege as practically 
    unintelligible. A requirement that cannot be fulfilled.

## Holism of Sellars and Quine
Holist/pragmatic arguments of Sellars (against sense-givenness) and Quine 
(against meaning-givenness) that connect epistemology and semantics:

- Sellars in [EPM](/docs/phil/people/sellars/works/epm/index.qmd) 
  - [Locke](/docs/phil/people/locke/index.qmd) got confused by conflating the 
    causation of a belief from its 
    justification.
  - Sense data may be causally prerequisite to knowledge, but it cannot justify 
    belief (it's not conceptually contentful, in the sense of standing in reason
    relations of implication/justification).
    - To stand in reason relations requires lots of other infrastructure, such 
      that atomic sense data cannot do this on its own (this is a semantic 
      holist argument)
    - How do we acquire knowledge in the semantic holist POV?
      - How to get into the game of giving and asking for reasons? "The light 
        dawns slowly over the whole" We need to get good enough at making the 
        'right' moves (as judged by 'competent speakers' before counting as a 
        'competent speaker'.
- Quine in [TDE](/docs/phil/people/quine/works/two_dogmas/index.qmd) 
  - Target: analytic truths, e.g. "cats are mammals" supposedly not depending on 
    any other commitments but rather immediately from the meanings of the words.
  - What is the practical difference between these truths and very general facts, 
    such as "there have been black dogs."
  - [Duhem-Quine thesis](/docs/phil/people/quine/duhem_quine.qmd)
    - What inferences we are allowed to make depends on the whole of collateral 
      beliefs we have.
- The unit of meaning must be the web-of-belief rather than the concept or the 
  sentence.
- [Fodor](/docs/phil/people/fodor/index.qmd) argues against this, considers 
  mixing epistemology and semantics to be a 
  big philosophical mistake initiated by Quine.


# Who is Rorty opposing?

Is Rorty attacking a strawman? Empiricism / Epistemic foundationalism is not 
popular now:

- "Default and challenge" structure a way of avoiding 
  [Agrippan trilemma](/docs/phil/problems/agrippan.qmd).
- Bayesianism sees all justification as comparative (never have to justify 
  one's prior commitments).
  - though the problem of semantics is still open if it is to not be 
    representationalist
- Naturalism + representationalism remains unchallenged.
  - picking an ontologically privileged base vocabulary
- So Rorty and [Price](/docs/phil/people/price/index.qmd) need to do one or 
  both of:
  1. Argue independently for [pragmatism](/docs/phil/definitions/pragmatism.qmd), 
     then use that to attack 
     representationalism without passing through foundationalism
  2. Argue independently against representationalism and propose pragmatism as 
     the best alternative approach

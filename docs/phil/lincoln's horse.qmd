Lincoln: How many legs does a horse have?

Witness: Four.

Lincoln: If we call a tail a leg, then how many legs does a horse have?

Witness: Well, I suppose the horse would have five legs.

Lincoln: Absolutely not, that’s wrong. Calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it a leg!


# Lessons
- When you specify counterfactuals, you still have to do this in your actual language.[^2d] 
- This correctly asserts that changing one's way of talking does not affect the order of *being* (this is one way of characterizing the order of being), though it can affect the order of *explanation*.


[^2d]: Two-dimensional modal logic is supposed to be a technical tool to allow us to specify counterfactuals in other languages.

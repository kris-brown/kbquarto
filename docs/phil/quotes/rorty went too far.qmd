> But Rorty then takes a step beyond all other pragmatists. Inquires aim not a truth, but at solidarity or what we have come to take as true. In his most extreme moods, he asserts that “truth” and “objectivity” are merely labels for what our peers will let us get away with saying ([40], p. 176). He would like to see a “post-philosophical culture” in which there are no appeals to authority of any kind, including appeals to truth and rationality. Truth is “not the sort of thing one should expect to have an interesting philosophical theory about”. We are to "substitute the idea of 'unforced agreement' for that of 'objectivity'" in every domain of inquiry - science as well as morals and politics.

For $P$ for some [preorder](/docs/math/defs/preorder.qmd) $(P, \leq)$:

- A subset $U$ of $P$ satisfying the condition $p \in U \land p \leq q \implies q \in U$
- Anything you add to the upper set means you have to add everything greater than it.

## Examples
- the possible upper sets of $Bool$ are $\{\varnothing, \{true\}, \{true, false\}\}$

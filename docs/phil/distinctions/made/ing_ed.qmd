Observed by [Sellars](/docs/phil/people/sellars) to be responsible for a lot of philosophical confusion.

Most interesting philosophical concepts come with a "-ing"/ "-ed"
distinction that's crucial to understand the nature of. 

## Description

Do you mean the describing or the describable when you say "description"?

We need to distinguish the fact and the content.


## Justification 

The [Agrippan trilemma](/docs/phil/problems/regress/agrippan.qmd) can be thought of as 
caused by conflating act of justifying vs the state of being justified.
  
## Experience

Is an experience an act of act of experiencing vs what's experienced. 
Sellars thinks [Berkeley](/docs/phil/people/berkeley) was confused by this.

## Representation

'Representation' is the relation between two relata: the representings and the 
representeds. Making this distinction helps avoid the 
[Cartesian](/docs/phil/distinctions/made/dualisms/mind_body.qmd) trap of thinking 
of the fact of $X$ as being a representing (e.g. a thought about something)
being an [*ontological*](/docs/phil/definitions/ontology.qmd) fact 
(i.e. a statement about the true nature of $X$) 
rather than a fact of how $X$ relates to other things (it could be 
represented in one context and a representing in another).

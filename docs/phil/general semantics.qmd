# Takeaway 

If we decide to treat objects as semantic interpretant of our names, sets of possible worlds as 
the semantic interpretant of our sentences, then: 

- one-place predicates correspond to *functions* from objects to sets of possible worlds.
- 'walks' is a function from objects to the worlds in which that object is 
    walking.
- adverbs, like 'slowly', is a function from one-place predicates to 
  one-place predicates.

This apparatus gives us a way to talk *precisely* about certain distinctions that come up in philosophy language. E.g. adverbs come in two flavors:
    - Attributive: 'walked *slowly*' which implies one walked at all
    - Non-attributive: 'walked *in one's imagination*'

We can now say what this distinction is, set-theoretically.

> It is one thing to say a belief is true because the logical consequences that flow from it fit in harmoniously with our otherwise grounded knowledge; and quite another to call it true because it is pleasant to believe. The essential difference between James’s and Peirce’s accounts of truth is that the Peirce latches on to the first option of which Pratt speaks. Peircean pragmatism links truth to good and satisfactory consequences - those which are empirically confirmed, fit with our otherwise grounded knowledge, etc.

In propositional logic, the law of the excluded middle is formulated as an inference rule:


=---=

$A \lor \neg A$ 


I.e., we can assume, for any proposition $A$, that either $A$ or its negation can be asserted. 

This gets applied in the form of inferring $A$ after proving $\neg \neg A$ (i.e. we assume not-$A$, then derive a contradiction, and conclude that $A$ is assertable).

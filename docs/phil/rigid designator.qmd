[Saul Kripke](/docs/phil/people/Saul Kripke.html)'s theory of the meaning of names (from [Naming and Necessity](/docs/phil/works/Naming and Necessity.html)) 
that is alternative to [descriptivism](/docs/phil/Descriptivism.html):

A name refers to the *same* object in all possible worlds in which that object exists, and the name never refers to anything else. 

How do we determine the referents of names?  The referent of a name is the object that initiated a chain of reference transmissions. 

- usually begins with a person proposing a name for an object; 
- people use the name to refer to that object without associating any particular description or cluster of descriptions with the name.

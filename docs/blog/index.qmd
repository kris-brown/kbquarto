The purpose of things written here is mostly to separate the things written in 
[Notes](/docs/notes.qmd) (which are written from a somewhat neutral / 
encyclopedic style) 
from stuff that is more opinionated. The primary types of things I expect to 
write are:

- connecting the dots between various things written in the Notes 
- expository material about content in the Notes and in 
  [Research](/docs/research.qmd)
- opinions / random thoughts / personal updates 

There are a few draft posts pending, but in the meantime here are two 
research-related posts I made to the 
[AlgebraicJulia blog](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/blog/):

- [Equality vs equivalence: computing isomorphism classes of C-sets](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/blog/post/2022/01/cset-automorphisms/)
- [The chase: data repair and logical reasoning](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/blog/post/2022/06/chase/)

A *metric space* has two ingredients:

- A set $X$ whose elements are called *points*
- A function $X \times X \xrightarrow{d} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ which gives the 
  distance between two points.
- These must satisfy three properties:

1. $d(x,y)=0 \iff x=y$
2. $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$
3. $d(x,y)+d(y,z)\geq d(x,z)$ (triangle inequality)
   
- An *extended metric space* includes $\infty$ in the codomain of the cost 
  function.

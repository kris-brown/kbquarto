# Caution: Work in progress 
A lot of things are not yet polished for
other people to read / make sense of them, but this is something I plan to do!
Color tags characterize their state of incompleteness:

- âšª: a stub, something not really finished 
- ðŸ”´: something is written but it hasn't been cleaned up at all. not fit for consumption
- ðŸŸ : some effort has been made but not yet presentable 
- ðŸŸ¢: presentable
- ðŸŸ£: a file without its own content (e.g. a collection of other pages)

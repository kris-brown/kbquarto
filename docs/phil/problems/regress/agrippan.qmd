It seems like there are only three ways of completing a proof:

- The *circular* argument, in which the proof of some proposition presupposes 
  the truth of that very proposition
- The *regressive* argument, in which each proof requires a further proof, ad 
  infinitum
- The *dogmatic* argument, which rests on accepted precepts which are merely 
  asserted rather than defended

These all tend to rub us the wrong way, but this is a problem for 
[classical logic](/docs/phil/definitions/classical_logic.qmd) in particular.

It could be addressed by introducing 
[nonmonotonic logic](/docs/phil/definitions/nonmonotonic_logic.qmd):  e.g. 
default and challenge approach to justification where some claims (e.g. 
first person observations) come with a default justification (which is not 
based on the justification of other claims). Yet they must be defended when 
challenged.

title: -ing/-ed distinction
---

Observed by Sellars to be responsible for a lot of philosophical confusion.

Most interesting philosophical concepts come with a "-ing"/ "-ed"
distinction that's crucial to understand the nature of. 

## Description

Do you mean the describing or the describable when you say "description"?

We need to distinguish the fact and the content.


## Justification 

The [Agrippan trilemma](/docs/phil/problems/agrippan.qmd) can be thought of as 
caused by conflating act of justifying vs the state of being justified.
  
## Experience

Is an experience an act of act of experiencing vs what's experienced. 
Sellars thinks [Berkeley](/docs/phil/people/berkeley) was confused by this.

## Representation

The representings and the represented.

## ???
- You can't be inside the rules and outside talking about them at the same time.

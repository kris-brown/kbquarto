- Related to [this quote](/docs/phil/people/sellars/works/cdcm/describing_wo_modality.qmd).
- What is the connection between the ([alethic](/docs/phil/definitions/alethic.qmd)) 
  modal sense of *must* and the normative sense of *must*?
- [Carnap](/docs/phil/people/carnap) uses 'transposed' to talk about 
  an unquoted word used in a sentence as a
  transposed mode of speech (about use of a quoted-word).
  - Examples:
    - "Red is a quality." vs  "'Red' is a one-place predicate."
    - "All $A$'s are necessarily $B$'s". vs the license to infer $B$ statements 
      from $A$ statements.

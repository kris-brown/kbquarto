Prove that the [upper sets](/docs/math/defs/upper_set.qmd) on a 
discrete [preorder](/docs/math/defs/preorder.qmd) for some 
set $X$ is simply the power set $P(X)$.

## Solution

- The upper set criterion is satisfied by any subset, thus all possible subsets 
  are upper sets.
    - The [binary relation](/docs/math/defs/relation.qmd) is equality, thus the upper subset 
      criterion becomes $p \in U \land p = q \implies q \in U$, or alternatively 
      $p \in U \implies p \in U$, which is always satisfied.

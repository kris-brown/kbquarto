[Author](/docs/phil/people/Wilfrid Sellars.html)

A (semantic) holist argument against meaning-givenness, like Quines' [Myth of the Museum](/docs/phil/Myth of the Museum.html) against sense-givenness.

It is common to think that knowledge begins with experience - that there are particular experiences (raw sense data) that are privileged as certain, leading to a desire to cache out all semantic interpretations of other thoughts in terms of these certain experiences (otherwise they are nonsense).

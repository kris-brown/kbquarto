title: Mind body dualism
---

Complaint about Cartesian dualism:

- if you're committed to "mind stuff" being non-extended.
- and to the physical world being extended.
- throw in some general claims about causation (e.g. it occurs in a place)
- then perception and agency become unintelligble (how is the mind affected by real stuff / how can the mind cause something?)

I wander in from a different culture, into an auction house:
    - There, the significance of waving your hand is bidding the next amount on whatever is being auctioned.
        - But all *I* know of the local customs is that waving usually is a greeting for people.
    - So, I go in there and greet my friend by waving.
        - I'm unaware that, in this context, doing that has the *significance* of bidding $500 for that armoire.
    - Now, if, as a matter of fact, I'm held responsible there ("You've implicitly accepted these rules by going into the auction house!"), then I've actually bid. That's what I've done.
        - Even though I didn't intend to do that, I didn't mean to do that. But I produced a performance that has that significance.


## A parallel story
- In Napoleon era, England, they needed sailors
    - This was a terrible life; nobody would want to do this.
    - Yet the law was that one had to *voluntarily* join Her Majesty's Navy.
- Because people were illiterate, taking the Queen's shilling from a duly authorized representative of Her Majesty's Government showed that you had voluntarily joined the service
    - If you did that, you *had* joined the Navy. You had committed yourself.
- So, they'd go to the bars and wait until somebody was drunk and out of money to say, "Like a shilling for another drink, mate?"
    - They weren't wearing the uniform or anything that shows that they were the duly authorized representatives
    - But they had the papers to show they were. You couldn't deny there were all these witnesses that you took the shilling from this person.
- This is an equivalent of having bid on the armoire: the law was, if you performed that act, regardless of intention, that counted as committing yourself.

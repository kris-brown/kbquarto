- Want to be able to answer questions about *resources* like:
    - Given what I have, is it *possible* to get what I want?
    - Given what I have, what is the *minimum cost* to get what I want?
    - Given what I have, what is the *set of ways* to get what I want?
- Monoidal preorders will allow us to build new recipes from old ones.
- Resources are not always consumed when used.
-  A $\mathcal{V}$ category is a set of objects, which one may think of as points on a map.
    -  $\mathcal{V}$ somehow 'structures the question' of getting from point $a$ to $b$.
    -  $\mathcal{V}$ = **Bool** answers the question of whether we can get to $b$.
    -  $\mathcal{V}$ = **Cost** can help answer how to get to $b$ with minimum cost.
    -  $\mathcal{V}$ = **Set** can yield a set of methods to get to $b$.

## [Empiricism](/docs/phil/schools/empiricism.qmd)
An empiricist approach to semantics wants to give semantics of an expression 
in terms of its 
[sense dependence](/docs/phil/distinctions/made/sense_dependence_reference.qmd) 
rather than its reference dependence.

## Functionalism
The meaning of a word is the role it plays in inferential reason relations.

## Crude causal theory

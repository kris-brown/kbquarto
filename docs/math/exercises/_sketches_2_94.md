Recall the power set [symmetric monoidal preorder](/docs/math/defs/smp.qmd) 
$(P(S),\subseteq, S, \cap)$ Is this a quantale?

## Solution
Yes, $0=\varnothing$ (it is related to everything) and the join of any pair of 
subsets is well-defined as their union. Because it is a SMP with all joins it 
is a quantale.

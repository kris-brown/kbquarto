- Imagine the points of a metric space are whole regions, like US, Spain, and Boston. Distance is "Given the worst case scenario, how far do you have to travel to get from region $A$ to $B$?"
- This actually breaks our symmetry requirement: $d(Boston,US)=0, d(US,Boston) > 0$
- Which distance is bigger in this framework: $d(Spain,US)$ or $d(US,Spain)$?

## Solution
- $d(US,Spain)$ is bigger because there is much more room for the worst case scenario to place one farther for Spain.
- A bigger first argument makes things strictly worse, all else equal. A bigger second argument makes things strictly better, all else equal.

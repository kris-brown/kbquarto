The opposite of a symmetric monoidal preorder $(X, \geq, I, \otimes)$ is still a symmetric monoidal preorder

## Proof
- Monotonicity: $x_1 \geq y_1 \land x_2 \geq y_2 \implies x_1 \otimes x_2 \geq y_1 \otimes y_2$
    - This holds because monotonicity holds in the original preorder ($a\geq b \equiv b \leq a$).
- Unitality, symmetry, and associativity are not affected by the preorder.

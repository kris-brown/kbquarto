Ordinarily we think of the [ontological](/docs/phil/Ontology.html) and the [deontological](/docs/phil/Deontology.html) as being very 
different, easily distinguishable kinds of things. However, Sellars' 
[quote](/docs/phil/quotes/Transposed language of norms.html)

{{< include "/docs/phil/quotes/transposed language of norms.qmd" >}}

expresses the idea that these are not so different and we can view ontological 
ideas as deontological (which has the added benefit of not excavating a gap 
between mind and world - it's no mystery how we can come to know how things 
actually are if it is a matter of understanding things like 
responsibility/social status).

Examples of this: 

- [representation as a normative relation](/docs/phil/Shopping list.html)
- [intentionality as a normative relation](/docs/phil/A children's game.html)
- more to come ...

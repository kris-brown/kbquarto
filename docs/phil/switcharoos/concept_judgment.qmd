title: Concepts and judgment
---


We normally think that the content of judgments are dictated by the content of the concepts used inside of them. This feels especially right for artificial languages:

- Take "If it's a $P$, then it's a $Q$."
    - Or, logically: $\forall x, P(x)\implies Q(x)$
- The meaning of this statement seems to depend on what concepts $P$ and $Q$ we substitute in. E.g. with $P \mapsto {\rm red\ thing},\  Q \mapsto {\rm colored\ thing}$, it's a good a judgment, whereas $Q \mapsto {\rm rectangular\ thing}$ would no longer be a good judgment.

However, Kant turned this around (see [here](/docs/phil/people/kant/index.qmd)). In this view, judgments are prior (in the order of understanding) to concepts.

This is also related to a switch of priority made by Sellars: we normally think of logically-valid inferences (e.g. $A \land B \implies B \lor C$) as something we understand *prior* to particular inferences (e.g. "If it's red and triangular, then it's triangular or heavy"). Sellars calls these particular inferences [material_inferences](/docs/phil/people/brandom/sellars09/2/material_inference.qmd) and argues that it is only through understanding them that we could understand logically-valid inferences.

One argument for our initial intuition is that the logically-valid inferences are *a priori*, whereas the particular inferences are *a posteriori*.[^1] However, [Achilles and the Tortoise](/docs/phil/problems/tortoise.qmd) feels relevant for arguing against this point of view: the logically-valid inferences exist *a priori* as abstract mathematical/syntactical objects, but without any practical experience of actually making inferential moves, we don't have access to them *qua* inferences.

[^1]: The words *priori* and *posteriori* literally make the order clear.

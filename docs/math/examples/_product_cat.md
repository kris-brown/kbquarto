The [product](/docs/math/defs/product.qmd) of two categories 
$\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D}$ may be given as 
follows:

- $Ob(C\times D)$ are the pairs $(c,d)$ where $c$ is an object of $\mathcal{C}$ 
  and $d$ is an object of $\mathcal{D}$.
- Morphisms are pairs $(c,d)\xrightarrow{(f,g)}(c',d')$ where 
  $c \xrightarrow{f}c'$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ and 
  $d \xrightarrow{g}d'$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{D}$.
- Composition is given by composing each entry in the pair separately.

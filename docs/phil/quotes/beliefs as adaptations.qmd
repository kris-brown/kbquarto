> But for Davidson...  reflection on what a belief is is not "the analysis of representation." Rather, it is reflection on how a language-using organism interacts with what is going on in its neighborhood.
Like Dewey, Davidson takes off from Darwin rather than from Descartes: from beliefs as  adaptations to the environment rather than as quasi-pictures.

>Such a theory is, instead, an account of how the marks and noises made by certain organisms hang together in a coherent pattern, one which can be fitted into our overall account of the interaction between these organisms and their environment.

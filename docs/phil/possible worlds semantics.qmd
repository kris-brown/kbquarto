Possible worlds semantics is a semantics for [Modal logic](/docs/phil/Modal logic.html).

John Etchemendy warns us to not confuse possible models in [Tarski](/docs/phil/Alfred Tarski.html) model theory with possible worlds in his _The Concept of Logical Consequence_. At the root of it is where the [Sortals](/docs/phil/Sortals.html) come from (which individuate individuals in the possible worlds).

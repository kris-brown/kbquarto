title: Pia's Maple Tree
---


Example from Charles Travis [-@wright1997companion] (*Pragmatics*, pg 97):

- Maple trees have red leaves naturally, but Pia paints them green.
- One day, a decorator asks her if she has any green leaves for her display, and Pia answers *yes*.
- Another day, a chemist asks her if she has any green leaves for her experiment on green leaf chemistry, and Pia answers *no*.
- In both cases, Pia answered truthfully.


The moral: any true sentence in some context has a context which would make its negation true.

- Constrast with Wittgensteinian image of "light dawning slowly on the whole". 
  Sellars is worried about the mechanism of how this happens.
- The idea of language as something that is necessarily (rather than 
  accidentally) criticizable is close to the 
  [private language argument](/docs/phil/people/wittgenstein/works/pi).

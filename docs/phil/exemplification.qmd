[Author](/docs/phil/Wilfrid Sellars.html)

> Exemplification is a ‘quasi-semantical’ relation, and it (and universals[^1]) are 
  “in the world” only in that broad sense in which the ‘world’ includes 
  linguistic norms and roles viewed (thus in translating) from the standpoint 
  of a fellow participant.

— [Naming and Saying](/docs/phil/Naming and Saying.html)

[^1]: e.g. redness, lionhood


- This plays off [Carnap](/docs/phil/Rudolf Carnap.html)'s notion of  'quasi-syntactical'.
- There's the narrow view of 'the world', that's the world that science is the 
  measure of all things. And the broader view of the world that has things like rules.

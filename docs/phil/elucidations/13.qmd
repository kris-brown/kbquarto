# What is it?
- A formal theory characterizing various ways to combine individual beliefs into 
  collective beliefs
- What could it mean for a group to have beliefs over and above the beliefs of 
  the individuals?
- We ascribe beliefs in order to interpret actions/decisions based on reasons
    - Groups act and make decisions based on reasons, so it seems reasonable to 
      think that we can ascribe beliefs to groups
- The group beliefs are uniquely determined by the individuals' beliefs, but it 
  may not be identical to any of the individuals.
    - Example: condo asssociation where 50% believe $A$ and 50% not $A$. Maybe 
      it's reasonable to ascribe an indeterminate belief towards $A$, but none 
      of the individuals is indeterminate.

# Importance
This is important because we want to know how we should revise our beliefs due 
to a group testimony.

# Proposal - rule by majority
What if we say the 'group believes' what the majority of the group believes?
- Problem: majorities are not consistent over multiple beliefs IF the beliefs 
  are logically connected.
    - 51% of people believe $P$, 51% believe $Q$, 1% believe $P\land Q$.
    - Under this proposal, the majority has inconsistent beliefs (and therefore 
      believes everything)
- Real example:
    - German politicians voted on the the three propositions:
      - Should Berlin or Bohn be the capital?
      - Should the parliament be in Berlin or Bohn?
      - Should the capital be where parliament is?

# Alternatives

- Supermajority:
    - If you construct threshold carefully enough, you can guarantee consistency
      - With $P\land Q$ example, you need 2/3.
- Determine ahead of time, determine what are most important (logically 
  independent) propositions, use inference to determine the rest of 
  propositions.
- Research in the field isn't really about finding specific alternatives:
    - Actual goal: formalize the desiderata and find out which sets of 
      constraints are compatible with each other.


# Independence constraint

- Mathematically provable that we can't satisfy a bunch of desiderata 
  simultaneously.
- However, one particular constraint both causes a lot of problems and really 
  isn't that justified: the independence constraint
- The collective belief on a particular proposition is uniquely determined by 
  opinions of the members of the group on that belief alone.
  - Our intuitive sense of collective belief is sensitive to the reasons for 
    belief.
    - Example:
      - Two panels: all believe that government and parliament should be in same 
        city, also all believe it should be in Berlin. Other is split on which 
        city things should be on, but all believe it should be in same city.
      - Independence would say that both panels agree 'equally' on whether 
        government+parliament should be in same city.
      - Intuitively we know that the second group has undermining/inconsistent 
        reasons for their agreed-upon belief, so their aggregate belief should 
        be strictly weaker than first panel.
  - Independence is usually involved in the unsatisfiable subsets of 
    constraints.

# Conclusion
- In practice, we recognize different judgment aggregation strategies are 
  appropriate in different scenarios
  - But this isn't a satisfying resolution in itself; we need to better 
    understand what makes certain desiderata appropriate for a given situation.

[Author](/docs/phil/people/Frederich Nietzsche.html)

> Truth is a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, anthropomorphisms, in short, a 
sum of human relations which were poetically and rhetorically heightened, 
transferred, and adorned, and after long use seem solid, canonical, and binding 
to a nation. Truths are illusions about which it has been forgotten that they 
are illusions.

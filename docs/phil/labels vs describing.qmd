[Author](/docs/phil/Wilfrid Sellars.html)

> It's only because the expressions in terms of which we describe 
objects, locate those objects in a space of implications that they describe it 
all rather than merely label. 

—  [Counterfactuals, Dispositions, and the Causal Modalities](/docs/phil/Counterfactuals, Dispositions, and the Causal Modalities.html) §108

- Describing is what science is the measure of all things about.
- You can't do everything with just classification. It's not a rich enough 
  concept to get you to descriptions.

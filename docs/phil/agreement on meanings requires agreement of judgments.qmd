[Author](/docs/phil/Ludwig Wittgenstein.html)
 
> It is not only agreement in definitions but also (odd as it may sound) in judgments that is required [for language to function... This is] agreement, not in opinions, but rather in form of life.

— [Philosophical Investigations](/docs/phil/Philosophical Investigations.html) § 241-242

> Uncritical semantics is the myth of a museum in which the exhibits are 
meanings and the words are labels. To switch languages is to change the 
labels.

Against the museum myth, [Quine](/docs/phil/W.O. Quine.html) argues here for the indeterminacy 
of "meaning" and translation.

A (semantic) holist argument against meaning-givenness, like Sellars' 
[Myth of the Given](/docs/phil/Myth of the Given.html) against sense-givenness.

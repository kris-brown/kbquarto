- Between the free square category and the commutative square category, there 
  is no functor from the commutative square category to the free square category 
  which keeps the corners in the same place.

- If we did this, we'd have $F(f;h)=F(g;i)$ (since these are the same morphism).
  
- The functor rules would allow us to break this up into $F(f);F(h)=F(g);F(i)$ 
  and we don't have a choice for those mappings other than $f;h=g;i$, something 
  that is not true in the free square category.

The *category of sets*, denoted **Set**:

- Objects are the collection of all sets.
- Morphisms are set-functions
- Composition is function composition (satsifies associativity), identities are 
  the identity functions (satisfies identity constraints).
- Closely related is the subcategory **FinSet** of finite sets with morphisms 
  being set-functions.

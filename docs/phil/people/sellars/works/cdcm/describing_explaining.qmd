- These two kinds of discursive activity; one can be describing in a
  particular act and not explaining (and vice-versa).
- Globally, they're only intelligible in terms of their relation to
  each other. 
  - ([describing is placing in a space of implications](/docs/phil/people/sellars/works/epm/space_of_reasons.qmd),
     which is relevant for explanation.
- The claim that matters: you couldn't have an
  [language](/docs/phil/definitions/autonomous_discursive_practice.qmd) 
  in use that had one and not the other.
- The reason is at least that in order to describe something you have
  to place it in a space of implications (i.e. the above quote)

It seems there is no problem thinking about what triangles and white things are, but what of triangularity and whiteness?

### Realism

Realism asserts that universals are real things, that *triangularity* does refer to something in the world, although perhaps some metaphysical realm.

[Plato](/docs/phil/people/Plato.html) is an example.

### Nominalism

[Berkeley](/docs/phil/people/George Berkeley.html) rejected Locke's view of abstract ideas on [empiricist](/docs/phil/Empiricism.html) grounds. For him *triangularity* is just a name that refers to all triangles, rather than referring to something in particular.

There are no abstract ideas, just particulars.

### Conceptual nominalism

One can accept that universals refer to things in the world but be clear that they are mental things (concepts). [Locke](/docs/phil/people/John Locke.html) is an example.

- Preorder: a binary relation on $X$ that is reflexive and transitive.
- A partial order (poset) has the additional constraint that 
  $x \leq y \land y \leq x \implies x=y$
      - We can always get a partial order from a preorder by 
        [quotienting](/docs/math/defs/quotientset.qmd), so it's not that special.
- A total order has all elements comparable.

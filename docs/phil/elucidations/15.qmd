# Why tolerate religion?
- Why protect religious conscience, over and above other forms of moral 
  conscience?
  - Historically, lots of religious intolerance have led to atrocities.
- What's distinctive of religious belief (not merely theistic religions)? Two 
  characteristics:
  1. There are certain beliefs that are insulated from ordinary standards of 
     reasons and evidence.
    - This is trying to cache out "faith"
  2. There are certain obligations that are demanded of a believer.
    - This is why religion comes in conflict with the law, so the need for 
      practices
  - Potential counterexamples:
    - Not let in enough: Christian apologists willing to argue/defend 
      Christiantity based on normal standards of evidence.
      - It's true there exist intellectualist traditions within religious 
        thought.
      - 1. Most believers want their beliefs insulated
      - 2. These are beliefs that are post-hoc rationalizations
      - Could say these are not religious hypotheses, although they deployed to 
        support religion.
    - Let in too much:  secular people have opinions about the meaning of life 
      that are not subject to reason/evidence. E.g. John Lennon thinks we should 
      give peace a chance, I'm commanded to not go to war.
      - Whether you think moral views are insulated from reasons/evidence 
        depends on deeper metaphysical views.
        - Naturalistic moral realist: morality is just like science, so it is 
          answerable to reasons and evidence
        - Noncognitivist: moral beliefs are actually expressing emotions, so not 
          applicable to rule 1.
- Neither of the distinctive characteristics are related to the standard 
  arguments for tolerating religion.
  - Utilitarian and Rawlsian arguments justify protecting liberty of conscience 
    but would not single out religion.

# More than mere toleration
- Nussbaum - doesn't religion deserve more than toleration, e.g. respect:
  - Mere toleration: you disapprove but you have to put up with them.
  - Respect is ambiguous:
    - 1. recognition respect: "you ought to respect his feelings"
      - respect for people in virtue of them being people
    - 2. appraisal respect: "I respect her intellect"
      - admiration
  - People conflate 1 (which is uncontroversially owed to strangers), but 
    bait-and-switch with meaning 2.
    - Nussbaum's example: Roger Williams founded Rhode Island and discovered the 
      Native Americans were more similar than he expected.
      - This still doesn't justify appraisal respect.

# Practical import of the argument
- Extend the practice of appealing for an exemption from a law to all matters of 
  conscience.
- Worrisome that courts will now have to judge whether matters truly are of 
  conscience.
    - It's easier to figure out if 1.) someone is a member of a religion, 2.) 
      if a religion demands a certain behavior rather than to figure out if a 
      person is being genuine.
- Maybe pragmatic reasons for status quo, but not moral reasons.

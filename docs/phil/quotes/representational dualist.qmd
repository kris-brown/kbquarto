> Until recently I had thought of myself as a straight up and down antirepresentationalist, in the tradition of Dewey, Wittgenstein and Rorty. But now – even if I’m still opposed to big-R Representationalism – I find that far from being an eliminativist about representation, I’m heading in the other direction: I’m a *dualist*, not a *nihilist*!

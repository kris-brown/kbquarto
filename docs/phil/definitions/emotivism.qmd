How can we, in our modern scientific world, come to know *moral* facts? This is 
a problem of [moral skepticism](/docs/phil/problems/is_ought.qmd).

Emotivism is a meta-ethical theory that addresses this by challenging the our 
concept of moral 'knowledge'. Rather than "X is good" being 
fact-stating (in the same kind of way "The frog is on the log" is fact stating), 
moral claims have the veneer of fact-statingness while really having the meaning 
of statements like "Yay, X!" or "Boo, X!".

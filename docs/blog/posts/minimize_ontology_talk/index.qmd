*This is essentially a rehash of various bits of [Rorty](/docs/phil/people/rorty) that were floating in my head, sort of put into my own words.*

[Ontology](/docs/phil/definitions/ontology.qmd) (the theory of what really is, 
or the what is there 'objectively') 
makes conflict between things we say possible.

- For example, the idea of objectivity needs to be invoked for there to be
incompatibility between "Alice thinks there is a saber-toothed tiger coming" and 
"Bob thinks there is no such tiger coming." 

We can think of the *social function* of the whole concept of objectivity as 
serving this purpose.

Clearly it's useful in some situations, especially 'ordinary empirical 
descriptive' (OED) language (e.g. "the frog is on the log"). So, we would lose the 
ability to cope with the world in important ways if we were to adopt a 
thoroughgoing idealism.

However, outside of the 'home language-game' of OED vocabulary, do we really 
need it? Could it be causing *unnecessary* conflict and confusion when pulled outside of its 
original motivating context, much like the 
[tooth pain](/docs/phil/situations/toothpain.qmd) anecdote?

For whatever sociohistorical reasons, objectivity-talk is incredibly pervasive
in almost all domains of discourse. It takes serious work to 
wean ourselves off of it, to show one can coherently and self-respectingly 
grapple with non-OED concepts without it. 

- For example: we're primed to think of *sentience* as some objective 
  phenomenon (because we're primed to be 
  [descriptivists](/docs/phil/definitions/descriptivism.qmd)), 
  but this is entirely unnecessary. 
- We can completely sidestep talk of the ontological nature of sentience and 
  get along perfectly fine.
- Given a real world problem that depends on this issue (e.g. "Is this AI a sentient 
  being?") this paradigm shift is a net positive because we can focus our a
  ttention on relevant things (our social practices relating to the AI, rather 
  than some feature purely of the source code).

However, if you want *power* over others, couching your beliefs in objectivity 
talk is useful for gaining authority.

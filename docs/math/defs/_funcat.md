The *functor category* between [categories](/docs/math/defs/cat.qmd) 
$\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$.

$\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{C}$ has all [functors](/docs/math/defs/functor.qmd) 
$\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ as objects and 
[natural transformations](/docs/math/defs/natural_transformation.qmd) as
 morphisms.

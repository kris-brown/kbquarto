Redescription is what produces new [vocabularies](/docs/phil/Vocabulary.html).

The process that produces redescriptions is *conversation*. [Conversation](/docs/phil/quotes/Pragmatism not atemporal.html) is about redescribing our vocabulary as much as using it. This is the same conversation that [platonists](/docs/phil/interaction/Pragmatism and platonism.html) try to end and pragmatists try to continue.

# Examples

- [Tooth pain](/docs/phil/Tooth pain.html)

# Caveat
"Redescription" is a bit of a misnomer since one can do other things with language than just describe (Rorty is no [descriptivist](/docs/phil/Descriptivism.html)). Better would be "recharacterization" or "reconceptualization".

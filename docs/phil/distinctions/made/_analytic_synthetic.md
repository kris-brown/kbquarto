Historically in philosophy, one finds a distinction frequently made 
between *analytic* and *synthetic* statements. We want to put declarative 
statements into two boxes:

1. Analytic:
   - "Cats are mammals"
   - "Every bachelor is unmarried"
2. Synthetic:
   - "There has existed a black dog"
   - "There are three people in this room right now"

How would we characterize analytic statements? One common way is to say that the 
truth of analytic statements depends purely on what the constituent terms *mean*, 
whereas synthetic statements (additionally) depend on the state of the world.

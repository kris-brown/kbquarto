A *unital commutative quantale* (or just *quantale*, in this book) is a 
[symmetric monoidal closed preorder](/docs/math/defs/closed_smp.qmd) 
$\mathcal{V}=(V,\leq,I,\otimes,\multimap)$ that has all 
[joins](/docs/math/defs/join.qmd).

- $\bigvee A$ exists for all $A \subseteq V$
- Denote the empty join as $0 := \bigvee \varnothing$

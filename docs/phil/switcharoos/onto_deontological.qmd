title: Ontological and deontological matters
categories: [ðŸ”´]

Ordinarily we think of the [ontological](/docs/phil/definitions/ontology.qmd) 
and the [deontological](/docs/phil/definitions/deontology.qmd) as being very 
different, easily distinguishable kinds of things. However, Sellars 
[quote](/docs/phil/people/sellars/works/im/transposed.qmd)

{{< include /docs/phil/people/sellars/works/im/_transposed.md >}}

expresses the idea that these are not so different and we can view ontological 
ideas as deontological (which has the added benefit of not excavating a gap 
between mind and world - it's no mystery how we can come to know how things 
actually are if it is a matter of understanding things like 
responsibility/social status).

Examples of this: 

- [representation as a normative relation](/docs/phil/situations/shoppinglist.qmd)
- [intentionality as a normative relation](/docs/phil/situations/childrensgame.qmd)
- more to come ...

An [empirical phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance): when a 
foraging bee discovers a supply of food, it returns to the hive and does a 
waggle dance. The rest of the hive then flies out in a certain direction and 
distance, locating the food. In some sense, the bee communicates the information 
of the food supply to the hive.

What's philosophically interesting about this?

- How do we talk about what the bee is doing?
- Is the bee 'speaking a language'? Is the bee saying *that* 'food is located in 
  this direction'?
- Can't we explain why a particular bee on one occasion does that by invoking 
  the pattern that it's an instance of?
    - What would it mean to say of a bee returning from a food source that its 
      turnings and wiggling has occurred *because* they're part of a complete 
      dance?
    - This is related to distinction of pattern governed vs rule obeying 
      behavior [-@sellars1954some]. Ruth Milliken, Sellars' student, devotes her 
      career to this, developing the field of *teleosemantics* and writing about 
      it in *Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories* [-@millikan1987language]

## Teleosemantics

A simpler example: imagine that beavers slap their tail when there's danger, and 
beavers flee when they hear another beaver slap its tail.

- The idea of teleosemantics is an evolutionary sort of semantics.
    - Acknowledge language use is normative (make distinction between correct 
      and incorrect use).
    - You have to draw the distinction in the way that's compatible with any 
      degree of badness of the participants actually following the rules.
    - We look at a reproductive family, the normal explanation (a tehcnial term) 
      of tail slapping is that, in the evolutionary history, lives were saved by 
      it.
    - When the explanation of the persistence of tail slapping turns on 
      particular events in the past where things worked well that way (expressed 
      in terms of counterfactuals - no tail slap, then species dies out), then 
      we can say its part of the proper function (technical term) to perform 
      that behavior.
    - This solves some puzzle cases: it allows us to say the proper function of 
      sperm is to fertilize eggs even if a vanishingly small fraction of them 
      actually do (because if they hadn't fertilized eggs in the past, there 
      wouldn't be sperm now).

- Well, this is the form of explanation for semantics in general. Because the 
  same thing can happen when the reproductive families are uses of words.
    - You can explain why we use the word 'Aristotle', as we do, if has having a 
      proper function of, in the end, referring to Aristotle, because if people 
      in the past had not used it, in particular ways, we wouldn't be using it 
      today.
    - And similarly, for predicates, and so on.
    - These are not biological norms. But we can understand words as having 
      proper functions in the same sense in which even in the merely biological 
      case, we can understand things as having proper functions. And we can 
      understand them as having proper signaling functions.
    - So, there's a proper function for producing these things and a proper 
      function for receiving them.
        - There, the analogy of the of the tail slaps is a good one.

- In order to understand semantic content, we don't need to use any principles 
  of explanation that aren't already intelligible.

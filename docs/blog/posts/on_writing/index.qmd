When I write, there are lots of qualification I would like to make. All words 
and combinations thereof have connotations and practical implications - some 
fraction of which will accurately reflect what I wish to communicate and some 
which will not. It seems like part of being a good writer is keeping that first 
fraction high and second one low without having to add endless parentheticals, 
qualifiers, and footnotes.

One explanation for in-person discussion being much more productive and having 
fewer miscommunications is that each false connotation can be immediately 
pursued and explained. In a static text document, one wants to both include 
all the qualifications yet knows this is too cumbersome / unreadable to 
actually do. 

I believe, technologically, there is a hope for nuanced communication (that 
does not require in-person interaction). Sharing a writing piece that is heavily 
interlinked with one's "digital garden" / "personal wiki" would allow readers to 
pursue threads as far as their curiosity permits without cluttering the main 
thrust of the writing. The process of constructing and sharing these is not yet 
at the point where it is as easy as Microsoft Word.

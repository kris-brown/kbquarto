- Examples of closure operators from logic.
- Take set of all propositions as a preorder, where $p \leq q$ iff $p$ implies $q$.
- Some modal operators are closure operators
- E.g. $j(p)$ means "Assuming Bob is in Chicago, $p$"
    - $p \implies j(p)$ (the logic is monotonic, adding assumptions does not make 
      something true into something false.
    - $j(j(p)) = j(p)$ (the assumption is idempotent)

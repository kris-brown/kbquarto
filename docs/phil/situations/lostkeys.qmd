A common metaphor used to critize someone's inquiry:

- One night, a drunk man is searching on the ground under a streetlight. An 
  officer approaches and asks "What are you looking for?"

- "My keys."

- They look together for a while until the officer asks, "Are you sure you 
  dropped your keys here?"

- The man replies, "No, over there" and points to a dark patch far from the 
  streetlight.

- "Why in God's name are you looking here, then?"

- "Because there's no light over there."

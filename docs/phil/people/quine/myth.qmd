> Uncritical semantics is the myth of a museum in which the exhibits are 
meanings and the words are labels. To switch languages is to change the 
labels

Against the museum myth, Quine argues here for the indeterminacy 
of "meaning" and translation.

A (semantic) holist argument against meaning-givenness, like Sellars' 
[Myth of the Given](/docs/phil/people/sellars/myth.qmd) against sense-givenness.

# Quotes 

## Describing the world without modality

> The idea that the world can in principle be so described that the description
contains no modal expressions is of a piece with the idea that world can in
principle be so described such that the description contains no prescriptive
expressions. 

- He doesn't explicitly say whether it's a bad idea or not.
- He wants to say modal expressions and normative expression belong in a box.

## Modal expressions as explanations
> To make firsthand use of modal expressions / subjunctive conditionals, is to
be about the business of explaining a state of affairs or justifying an
assertion. 

- Note: we *explain* an (actual) state of affairs. We *justify* an assertion
(non-actual, in the space of reasons).

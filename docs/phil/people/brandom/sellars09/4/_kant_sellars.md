From three premises:

1. what you need to move from labeling to describing is situation in a space of 
   implications
2. space of implications must draw lines between implications that will between 
   counterfactual circumstances under which the implication would still be good, 
   and those in which wouldn't
3. the expressive job, not in the first instance, a descriptive job that's 
   characteristic of modal vocabulary is to make explicit those range those 
   implications and those ranges of counterfactual robustness

Put another way, suppose Sellars is right that modal expressions function as 
inference licenses. If it could be argued that those counterfactually robust 
inferences are essential to articulating the content of ordinary empirical 
descriptive concepts, then you'd have an argument to the effect that the 
capacity to use modal concepts what modal concepts make explicit is implicit 
already in the use even of ordinary empirical, descriptive, non modal concepts.

It's explicit in Sellars, all but explicit in Kant. Some consequences:

- modal vocabulary is not something that you can casually add to ordinary 
  descriptive vocabulary, like culinary vocabulary. Rather, the distinctive 
  expressive job of modal vocabulary is to articulate the inferential 
  connections among descriptive concepts in virtue of which they have the 
  content that they do.

- just in being able to use ordinary empirical descriptive vocabulary, non
  modal vocabulary anyone already knows how to do everything they need to know 
  how to do in order to use modal vocabulary. They merely make explicit what is 
  implicit in non-modal concepts.

- One cannot be in the predicamant that Hume took himself to be in. We can 
  teach you how to use modal vocabulary. You may not have a word for it yet. 
  That's what we'll give you. But you already know how to *do* everything you 
  need to know how to do to use that word to talk with 'necessity', 
  'possibility' and the subjunctive.

- Description and explanation are two sides of one coin.

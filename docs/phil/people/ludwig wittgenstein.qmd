# Quotes

## Language has no downtown
A view attributed to Wittgenstein by Brandom: "Language has no downtown." / 
"Language is a motley"

- It's all suburbs. There's no part of it such that everything else is
arrayed around it as a suburb of it.
- Sellars disagrees: thinks the downtown is giving and asking for reasons.

A [Kantian](/docs/phil/Immanuel Kant.html) insight: the *real* problematic [skepticism](/docs/phil/Skepticism.html) is *semantic* skepticism.

- He doesn't take it for granted that we can 'represent' reality and merely have to worry about whether or not that representation is true.
- It might be unintelligible that our mental states even purport to specify how things are out there.
- This is a prior question to whether or not those purported claims are true.

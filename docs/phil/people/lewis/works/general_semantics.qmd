[-@lewis1976general]

If we decide to treat 
objects as semantic interpretant of our names, sets of possible worlds as 
the semantic interpretant of our sentences, then one-place predicates 
correspond to functions from objects to sets of possible worlds.

- 'walks' is a function from objects to the worlds in which that object is 
    walking.
- adverbs, like 'slowly', is a function from one-place predicates to 
  one-place predicates.
- This apparatus gives us a way to talk precisely about certain distinctions 
  that come up in philosophy language. E.g. adverbs come in two flavors:
    - Attributive: 'walked *slowly*' which implies one walked at all
    - Non-attributive: 'walked *in one's imagination*'

Consider the graphs $G,H$ from [this example](/docs/math/examples/arrtable.qmd). 
We claim there is 
exactly one graph homomorphism such that $\alpha_{Arr}(a)=d$. What is the other 
value of $\alpha_{Arr}$, and what are the three values of $\alpha_{Vert}$?

## Solution
- We need $2 \mapsto 5$, so the source of $\alpha_{Arr}(b)$ must be $5$ (there 
  is only one arrow to pick, $e$).
- $1 \mapsto 4,\ 2\mapsto 5,\ 3 \mapsto 5$

One source of philosophical controversy is that of 
[universals](/docs/phil/universals.qmd).

To me, this seems to be an instance of the 
[tooth pain](/docs/phil/tooth pain.qmd) issue. 

Here is an account: 

- Noun-ness *was* for ordinary objects (with obvious ontological status) in 
an earlier language game. E.g. rocks, tigers, hands.
- Our creativity with language / grammatical led us to nounify many other 
words, leading to 'objects' with unclear ontological status.

### Engaging with the other accounts of universals
To do...

- realism
- nominalism 
- conceptual nominalism

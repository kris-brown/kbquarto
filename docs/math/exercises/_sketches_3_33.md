Someone says that the only [isomorphisms](/docs/math/defs/iso.qmd) in 
$\mathbf{Free}(G)$ for some graph $G$ are the identity morphisms. Are they 
correct?

## Solution
They are correct. If we could compose $f;g$ to get a morphisms from $c$ to $c$, 
a free category would pick a new morphism rather than re-use the identity (which 
could be forced with a constraint).

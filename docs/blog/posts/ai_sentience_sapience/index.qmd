# Summary

Thesis: AI discourse stands to benefit from making a distinction between 
*sentience* and *sapience*, both of which are flavors of "intelligence". 

Key points, if you accept that distinction as legitimate / enlightening:

- People *think* they are having empirical disputes (e.g. are current/future AIs 
  'intelligent'?), but these are actually hollow / merely confusion which follows 
  from conflating sentience and sapience (AI is sentient but not sapient).
- If our social practices were to sufficiently change, AI *could become* sapient 
  and mankind *could become* merely sentient. This would be bad. Mankind 
  appreciating the distinction would help prevent this from happening.

## Caveat on materialism 

Although sometimes in the 21st century we have very materialist impulses, I want 
to claim it is possible for some truths to not be in the domain of natural 
science. This doesn't have to invoke religion or anything mystical: 

- what is the simplest way to continue the sequence 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...?
- is torturing helpless strangers morally wrong?
- who has right-of-way in this intersection?
- what influence did Elliot's _The Wasteland_ have on the poetic landscape?

A materialist's impulses might recoil at this thought, forced to declare 
the answers to these questions aren't really facts *because* science does not 
have authority; they can argue there's no "fact" of the matter, at best we can 
do is some sort of subjective feeling that happens to obtain agreement among the 
right sort of people.

# Sapience vs sentience

This distinction is due to Wilfrid Sellars.

**Sentience** is the kind of intelligence squirrels have. To sentient creatures, 
we attribute having sensations and behaving in pattern-governed ways to survive 
in an environment.

**Sapience** is the kind of intelligence humans above a certain age have. To 
sapient creatures, we attribute the use of *concepts*, the ability to make 
claims, be committed to claims, be entitled to claims, and be held responsible 
for claims.

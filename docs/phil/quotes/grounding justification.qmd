[Author](/docs/phil/people/Richard Rorty.html)


> The issue is not adequacy of explanation of fact, but rather whether a practice of justification can be given a "grounding" in fact. The question is not whether human knowledge in fact has "foundations, " but whether it makes sense to suggest that it does-whether the idea of epistemic or moral authority having a "ground" in nature is a coherent one.

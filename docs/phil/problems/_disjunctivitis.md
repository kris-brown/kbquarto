An easy way to tell if someone saying $P$ means $\phi$ rather than $\psi$ by 
some observable concept is to show them $\phi$'s (witness them say $P$) and 
$\psi$'s (and witness them not say $P$). Call this witnessing the distinction 
via *dispositions* of the $P$-speaker. *Disjunctivitis* is a thought experiment 
that says this is not a sufficient tool for us to distinguish $\phi$'s and 
$\psi$'s generally. This is a Kripkensteinian problem.

We're worried about whether the word 'porcupine' really means *porcupine*, or 
whether it means *porcupine or echidna*. Because most of us porcupine users 
can't tell porcupines from Australian echidnas. And, although everything I've 
ever seen in called a 'porcupine' was a *porcupine*, everything I've ever seen 
called a 'porcupine' was also a *porcupine or echidna*. And the question is, 
well, what what fact is it in virtue of which 'porcupine' means *porcupine*, 
and not *porcupine or echidna*?

You can't tell it from my dispositions on the output side, and on the input 
side, though, it might have been equally true that they've all been porcupines 
they've also been porcupines or echidnas. (Furthermore, for all I know, they all 
happened to have been been male porcupines, in which case we have to worry that 
my word porcupine means male, porcupines and again, I can't tell them from the 
female ones.

Solution from Sellars: the people who taught you the word porcupine, what 
pattern were they trying to inculcate in you? Was it to say 'porcupine' when 
confronted with a *porcupine or echidna*? This is a crucial piece of how the 
noise 'porcupine' coming out of my mouth means *porcupine*.

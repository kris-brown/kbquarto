The category $\mathbf{Free}(G)$, given a 
[graph](/docs/math/defs/graph.qmd) $G=(V,A,s,t)$

- A [category](/docs/math/defs/cat.qmd) whose objects are vertices and 
  morphisms are paths.
- The identity morphism is the trivial path at any vertex.
- Composition is path concatenation (this obeys unitality and associativity)

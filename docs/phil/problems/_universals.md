It seems there is no problem thinking about what triangles and white things are, 
but what of triangularity and whiteness?

### Realism

Realism asserts that universals are real things, that *triangularity* does refer 
to something in the world, although perhaps some metaphysical realm.

[Plato](/docs/phil/people/plato/index.qmd) is an example.

### Nominalism

[Berkeley](/docs/phil/people/berkeley/index.qmd) rejected Locke's view of abstract ideas on empiricist grounds. For him 
*triangularity* is just a name that refers to all triangles, rather than 
referring to something in particular.

There are no abstract ideas, just particulars.

### Conceptual nominalism

One can accept that universals refer to things in the world but be clear that 
they are mental things (concepts). [Locke](/docs/phil/people/locke/index.qmd) is an example.

A [Kantian](/docs/phil/people/kant) insight: the *real* problematic skepticism 
is *semantic* skepticism.

- He doesn't take it for granted that we can 'represent' reality and 
  merely have to worry about whether or not that representation is true.
- It might be unintelligible that our mental states even purport to 
  specify how things are out there.
- This is a prior question to whether or not those purported claims are 
  true.

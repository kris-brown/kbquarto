> So naturalists should embrace the pragmatist–expressivist shift from philosophising about objects to philosophising about vocabularies, in my view—embrace the lesson that a proper naturalism about subjects may undercut the motivation for a common form of naturalism about objects. This is why it matters, and why virtue requires that we stay on what I want to identify as the Dewey-Wittgenstein-Rorty side of the fence: resolutely opposed to the kind of representationalism that gives metaphysics a free ride (on the back of the study of vocabularies). *Expressivism isn’t a way of doing metaphysics in a pragmatist key. It is a way of doing something like anthropology*.

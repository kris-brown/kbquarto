> Anything which can properly be called 'conceptual thinking' can occur only 
within a framework of conceptual thinking in terms of which it can be criticized, 
supported, refuted (in short, evaluated). To be able to think is to be able to 
measure one's thoughts by standards of correctness, of relevance, of evidence 
[^2]. In this sense the diversified conceptual framework is a whole which 
(however sketchy) is prior to its parts, and cannot be construed as a coming to 
gether of parts which are conceptual in character. The conclusion is difficult 
to avoid that the transition from preconceptual patterns of behavior to 
conceptual thinking is a holistic one, a jump to a level of awareness that is 
irreducibly new. A jump which was the coming of the being of man.

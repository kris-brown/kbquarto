These notes were hastily made for personal use. In the future they'll be made more presentable.

It feels natural to try to reduce concepts to combinations of sense impressions (this is what Locke/Hume do). This is a mistake that comes from the fact that sense impressions are *causally prior* to our concepts. This does not mean they are *conceptually prior*.

Sense data itself is not contentful/conceptual in nature and cannot stand in relations of justification/implication.

# Quotes

## Language has no downtown
A view attributed to Wittgenstein by Brandom: "Language has no downtown." / 
"Language is a motley"

- It's all suburbs. There's no part of it such that everything else is
arrayed around it as a suburb of it.
- Sellars disagrees: thinks the downtown is giving and asking for reasons.

## What is ... questions

The questions:

 - "What is length?"
 - "What is meaning?"
 - "What is the number one?"
 - etc.

produce in us a mental cramp. We feel that we can't point to anything in reply 
to them and yet ought to point to something. [-@wittgenstein1958blue]

- We are up against one of the great sources of philosophical bewilderment: we 
  try to find a substance for a substantive.

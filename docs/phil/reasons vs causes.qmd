A distinction closely related to [Sense dependence vs reference](/docs/phil/Sense dependence vs reference.html).

Causes are in the realm of the world of science, which is related to but distinct from the [space of reasons](/docs/phil/Space of reasons.html). 

Conflating these two leads to [empiricism](/docs/phil/Empiricism.html), where the meaning of our ideas must be reduced to sense impressions (because, causally, our conceptual activity depends on them). Kant phrases this as "giving a mere physiology of the understanding".

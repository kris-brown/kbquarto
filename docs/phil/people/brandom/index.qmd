## Slogans
### Concepts
> It's not about our grip on concepts[^1]; it's about the concept's grip on us.

- this could also go in [Switcharoos](/docs/phil/switcharoos/index.qmd)

[^1]: this characterizes the pre-Kantian tradition

### On Kant and Hegel
> One cannot open the door enough for Kant to get through while being able to slam it shut before Hegel gets through. (Hegel was too interesting of a reader of Kant)

### Sapience
> It's not what's between your ears, it's what's between you and your peers.

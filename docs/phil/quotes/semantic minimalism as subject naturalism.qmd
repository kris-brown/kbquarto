> Semantic minimalism offers a selfconsciously nonmetaphysical approach to truth, while focussing on practical questions about what we can *do* with a truth predicate that it would be difficult or impossible to do without it. And expressivism focusses directly on the distinctive use of (say) moral or modal vocabulary—thereby, once again, sidestepping traditional metaphysical concerns about nature of moral or modal states of affairs.

title: Making sense of an objective vocabulary
draft: true
---

Laypeople think of language as representing the objective world. They usually 
don't think whether this means *some* language represents the world or *all* 
language represents the world. A classic example:

- the frog is on the log


Upon reflection, commonsense says that some things one says are *nonsense* and 
we don't need to explain the meaning of nonsense in terms of what in the world 
it is representing.

One pragmatist-friendly way of characterizing what someone means by saying 
"this vocabulary represents the world objectively" is to say that, 
for any possible aim/goal, 

Rorty talks about this as the idea of language as a tool. This requires 
the goal to be specified *independently* of a particular tool 
for it (e.g. language). But goals aren't like that - they are only statable in language.

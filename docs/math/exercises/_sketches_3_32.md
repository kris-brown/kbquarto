A monoid in which every morphism is an [isomorphism](/docs/math/defs/iso.qmd) 
is known as a *group*

1. Is the [natural numbers monoid](/docs/math/examples/naturals_cat.qmd) a group?
2. Is the monoid with the added constraint $s;s=z$  a group?

## Solution
\begin{}
1. No, $s$ has no inverse (no natural number can be added to 1 to get 0)
2. Yes, this is the cyclic group with two elements.

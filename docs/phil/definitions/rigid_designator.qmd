[Kripke](/docs/phil/people/Kripke)'s theory of the meaning of names 
(from [Naming and Necessity](/docs/phil/people/Kripke/works/naming_and_necessity/)) 
that is alternative to 
[descriptivism](/docs/phil/definitions/descriptivism.qmd):

A name refers to the *same* object in all possible 
worlds in which that object exists, and the name never refers to anything else. 

How do we determine the referents of names?  
The referent of a name is the object that initiated a chain of 
reference transmissions. 

- usually begins with a person proposing a name for an object; 
- people use the name to refer to that object without associating 
  any particular description or cluster of descriptions with the name.

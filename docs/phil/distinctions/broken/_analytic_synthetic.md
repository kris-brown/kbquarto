The distinction is made 
[here](/docs/phil/distinctions/made/analytic_synthetic.qmd)
but is broken in [Quine](/docs/phil/people/quine/index.qmd)'s  
[Two Dogmas of Empiricism](/docs/phil/works/two_dogmas/index.qmd)
is the notion of analyticity, 
i.e. that the analytic-synthetic distinction can be made at all.

He argues that the type of information required to make us change our opinion of 
the truth of "cats are mammals" and any synthetic statement are actually not 
different in kind. (We might discover all things that which call 'cats' have 
actually been biological-looking robots - we'd likely change what category to 
put 'cats' in than to declare all of these things are no longer cats.)

Quine's conclusion: we should cease to make the meaning-theory distinction / 
language-theory distinction / meaning-belief distinction --- all there is is the 
use of our expressions, and the usage is what determines both the meanings and 
what we take to be true.

Quine's target is Carnap (who is thinking of artificial languages: first you fix 
the language and then you go into the world to see which are true in virtue of 
what they mean).

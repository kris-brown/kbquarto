- "How possible" questions
  - General form: X makes Y seem impossible, yet nevertheless Y is possible.
    - Can't we just reject X because we take Y to be possible, which contradicts 
      taking X seriously?
  - Y="how is freedom possible?"
    - X = "we are chemical/physical beings"
  - "how is knowledge of the external world possible?"
    - X = skepticism "How do you know you're not dreaming / in the Matrix?"
      - you don't independently know that you're not in the Matrix /
        [brain in the vat](/docs/phil/problems/skepticism.qmd), so how could you 
        know that your hand is in front of you?
      - The skeptic has put an insuperable requirement for knowledge of the 
        external world
        - Two possible replies:
          - Say the requirement is not genuine
            - More promising since requirements are usually designed to be 
              unfulfillable (though they still are very compelling)
          - Challenge the word "independently"
            - challenging skeptic's assumed notions of epistemic priority 
              because you are accused of question begging if you say "I know I 
              have a hand, so therefore I'm not a handless brain in a vat"
            - GE Moore strategy: argue from knowledge to knowledge rather from 
              ignorance to ignorance.
          - Say we can satisfy the requirement
  - Sherlock Holmes meets you for the first time and says "ah I see you're from 
    NJ". "how did sherlock holmes know this?"
    - X = "given that I didn't do anything to reveal my origin"
- [Kant](/docs/phil/people/kant) 'grandfather of how possible 
  questions' and inventor of trancendental arguments
  - How is mathematical knowledge possible? How is pure science possible?
    - For the former, Kant answers by drawing attention to how diagramatic 
      reasoning is crucial.
    - One can respond to how diagrams (with, say, specific triangles) could 
      prove general properties (e.g. about triangles in general) and Kant has a 
      response.
  - He's not asking from an epistemological perspective.
  - These are interesting b/c they are examples of synthetic a priori
    - How is that kind of knowledge possible? (given that it must be possible in 
      virtue of mathematical knowledge existing)
    - X = "where does the knowledge come from if not experience nor analysis of 
      concepts?"
  - Trancendental argument:
    - start off with assumption we have a certain experience, then try to find 
      necessary conditions for us to have that experience
    - E.g. external world skeptics believe we have inner experience. Kant argues 
      that outer experience is a necessary precondition for inner experience. 
      Therefore we have knowledge of the external world.
      - This doesn't answer the 'how possible' question. It shows that Y is true 
        but does not dissolve the obstacle X. So again we have something that 
        seems necessarily true that asserts something that's possible is 
        impossible. The skeptic has the upper hand since their arguments aren't 
        as abstract / untrustworthy.
      - But it's not like Kant thinks his trancendental arguments were designed 
        to answer his 'how possible' questions (some commentators make the 
        mistake of assuming this).

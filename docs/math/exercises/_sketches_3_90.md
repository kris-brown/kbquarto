1. What are identity morphism in a 
   [product category](/docs/math/examples/product_cat.qmd) 
   $\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D}$?
2. Why is composition in a product category associative?
3. What is the product category $1 \times 2$?
4. What is the product category of two [preorders](/docs/math/defs/preorder.qmd)?

## Solution
1. For object $(c,d)$, the identity morphism is $(id_c,id_d)$
2. The operation was defined in terms of function composition which is 
   associative.
3. It is [isomorphic](/docs/math/defs/iso.qmd) to just **2**.
4. The underlying set is the cartesian product, and 
   $(a,b)\leq(a',b')$ iff $a \leq a' \land b \leq b'$.

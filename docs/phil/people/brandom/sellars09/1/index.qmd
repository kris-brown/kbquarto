# Introduction
Brandom believes Sellars to be the most important American philosopher of the 
20th century. Some ways in which Sellars was remarkable:

- Sellars had a systematic / synoptic vision, which was rare for 
  analytic philosophers (who largely preferred to write 'gem-like' articles). 
  - This makes it also hard to read Sellars - it's hard to get a hold of one piece 
    of it without getting the whole. 
- Sellars had an almost unique knowledge of and 
  appreciation for the significance of the *history* of philosophy 
  - (not just a subdiscipline, but rather as the language in which philosophy is pursued).[^world]
- Sellars' overall aim was to move analytic philosophy from its Humean phase to its Kantian phase.
  - Epitomizes his views towards empiricism/naturalism (which had characterized 
    analytic philosophy). 
  - That Kant was worth respecting a radical view at the time - he had been 
    written out of the canon due to his connection to 
    [Hegel](/docs/phil/people/brandom#on-kant-and-hegel).[^1]
  - Rawls on the practical side and Strawson/Bennett on the practical side 
    brough Kant back into respectability in Anglaphone circles, but Sellars was 
    way out in front of this (and appreciated the significance of Kant deeper). 
  - This is also why Sellars wasn't so influential - people didn't understand 
    the Kant needed to appreciate him.

## Kant's influence on Sellars
Kant's big idea:

What is sapience? (what distinguishes *knowers* and mere responders to an environment?)

- It's not some presence of "mind-stuff" (i.e. Cartesian dualism)
- It's that judgments and intentional doings are things that knowers and agents 
    are in a distinctive sense *responsible for*.
- Judgments express commitments of those subjects / their exercises of authority 
- The difference between mind minded things and 
unmined and things isn't an ontological one, but a *de*ontological one.

*Judgment* is important for Kant 

- it is the minimal thing that we can 
be held accountable for (the smallest unit of consciousness)
- The form of the judgment has two parts:
  - Subjective: the "I think ..." that can accompany any judgment 
    - *Who* is responsible
  - Objective: "object = x" 
    - what you make yourself responsible *to* by taking the judgment
    - what you need to consult in order to determine the correctness

Cartesian questions are about our grip on concepts. Thinking about concepts as 
rules for making judgments, Kantian questions are about the concepts' grip on us.

- A concept is the rule you bind yourself to by calling the coin 'copper'. (You 
commit yourself, whether you know it or not, to it's being an electrical
conductor, melting at a particular temperature, etc.).

- Rather than a Cartesian mind-body problem, it's a norm-fact problem. The relationship 
  between prescription and description - that's what is special about *us*.

Hegel took this Kantian question and observed that normative status are 
socially instituted statuses - we have to look at social practices to understand 
what responsibility / authority are. (this idea was reintroduced indepenently 
by the later Wittgenstein - for example his 
[children's game](/docs/phil/situations/childrensgame.qmd) investigates the 
normative significance of beliefs/desires/intentions).


Sellars on what is philosophy: "the attempt to say how things, in the largest sense of that term, hang together, in the largest sense of that term." 


[^world]: This is one dimension along which the world spirit has caught up with 
          Sellars.


# Core programs of analytical philosophy
Analytic philosophy held together as being a *semantic* project. 

- Understand the meanings of potentially-problematic target vocabularies in 
  terms of the meanings of putatively-unproblematic base vocabularies. 
  - Some debate over what the relation between target and base vocabularies needs to be:
    - definability
    - translatability
    - paraphrasability
    - "analyzable in terms of"
    - reducibility
    - supervenience
- Examples:
  - *On denoting*: problematic vocabulary is definite descriptions, translated 
    into the unproblematic vocabulary of FOL with identity.
  - Frege's problematic vocabulary was arithmatic statements, which were made 
    sense of in quantificational logic with identity.
- Things like intentional, normative, metaphysical vocabularies were typically 
  problematic.
  - Core programs of empiricism and naturalism can be understood as having 
    different choice of base vocabularies
    - Empiricism: base language is sensory experience (e.g. a language of sense 
      data, language of how things seem or appear)
    - Naturalism: language of natural science (possibly just fundamental 
      physics or broader)
    - The Vienna Circle was divided into two wings. Schlict (empiricist) and Neurath 
      (naturalist), and Carnap in between. Prime source of tension between them was 
      modality / lawlikeness. 
  - *Functionalism*: Unproblematic vocabulary is talking about how something 
    plays a role in a larger system. (paradigmatically shows up in the 
    philosophy of mind.)
      - Sellars was the first functionalist. broader than the sense that it 
        comes up in the philosophy of mind: Sellars is a *semantic* functionalist.

Another reason why Sellars is important is his distinctive views about 
empiricism, naturalism, and functionalism.

## Role of logic 

Logic as developed in the early 20th century is a powerful tool for giving us 
inferential control. Logical empiricists found this tool indispensible. 
They viewed the early empiricists (e.g. Locke, Hume) as 
having the right building blocks, but "association" was too weak of a mortar to 
hold them together and build the edifice of knowledge of the objective world.
Although Sellars isn't a logical empiricist, he also found logic to be a useful
tool and can be thought of as a logical Kantian. After Kant, the nextmost 
important philosopher for Sellars was Carnap. (despite Carnap's empiricism.)

# Summary of views

It is debated whether or not Sellars was an empiricist, but Brandom does not 
think so.

{{< include /docs/phil/people/sellars/works/epm/_space_of_reasons.md >}}

- This is a powerful weapon against empiricist reductionisms of all sorts, 
  according to Brandom.

# Historical Kant Context

[Kant](/docs/phil/people/kant) was not in favor within 
[analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy) when 
Sellars began, due to Kant's connection to 
[Hegel](/docs/phil/people/brandom#on-kant-and-hegel)[^1]. However, this is 
ironic because Kant is incredibly analytical and science-driven.

[^1]: [Hegel](/docs/phil/people/hegel/works/spirit) was the 'Great Bad' 
      of Anglophone philosophy

Three ideas of Kant that mattered to Sellars:

## Freedom
- [Rousseau](/docs/phil/people/rousseau) said 
  "Obedience to a law that one has laid oneself is freedom."
- Kant turned this around to distinguish *constraint by norms* from *constraint 
  by power*.


## Normativity
Kant's *normative* understanding of discursive practice[^2]

[^2]: i.e. practice relating to *concepts*.

How do we understand the difference between concept-using, sapient beings from 
mere responders to the natural environment? Here are two possible ways to 
think of it:

- $O$: An *ontological* distintion: knowers are an actually different kind 
  of thing (perhaps there is a presence of 'mind stuff' or 'spirit stuff').
- $D$: A *deontological* distinction: we *treat* knowers differently from 
  objects. There are things that the agents are in a distinctive sense 
  *responsible* for [^3].
- Both sides treat $D$ as true, but Team $O$ furthermore believes $O$ is true 
  and that the order of explanation is $O \implies D$. However, Team $D$ takes 
  $D$ as essential and needs not make any claim about ontology.

Downstream of this are many of Kant's innovations.

- The minimum unit of awareness/experience is the *judgment*
    - this comes from taking $D$ to be fundmental: it is the smallest thing 
      we can be held responsible for
    - Everything else (particular concepts like *Fido the dog*, universal 
      concepts like *triangularity*, logical concepts) has to be understood 
      in terms of the function it plays with respect to judgment.
- The *subjective* form of judgment (the "I think..." that can accompany all 
  judgments)
    - Because it can accompany all representations, this is the emptiest 
      form of judgment.
    - The mark of "who is responsible for the judgment".
    - To say "*I think* it is raining now." is to emphasize that *I* am 
      responsible (e.g. subject to criticism if you go outside and don't 
      get wet).
- The *objective* form of judgment (the "$x$ is ..." or "$x$ = ..." for some 
  object $x$).
    - Mark of what you've made yourself responsible to.
    - When saying "That stone is 50 pounds.", the stone has a certain 
      authority over me (one looks to the stone to see whether I am right or 
      wrong; it sets the standards of correctness). See the 
      [shopping list scenario](/docs/phil/situations/shoppinglist.qmd).

[^3]: This point is shared by the later 
[Wittgenstein](/docs/phil/people/wittgenstein). The 
[puzzles](/docs/phil/situations/childrensgame.qmd) that Wittgenstein offers us 
(along the way to trying to dissolve the presuppositions that make it puzzling) 
center around the normative significance of beliefs/desires/intentions.

## Concepts
- In addition to concepts whose principle expressive job is to describe/explain 
  empirical goings-on, there are concepts whose principle expressive job it is 
  to make explicit the framework that makes description possible.
    - These are known *a priori* framework-explicating concepts.
    - This is Kant's response to [Hume](/docs/phil/people/hume), 
      for how we can understand the modal force 
      of laws in virtue of their non-modal description.
        - The answer is in the description framework itself.
        - The fact that there are necessarily relations that concepts have among 
          another makes description possible (a concept being contentful at all 
          requires it to have some necessary relations to other concepts).
- What Sellars means by 'ushering philosophy from its Humean phase to its Kantian 
  phase' is putting categories front and center.
    - Trying to *describe* the modal structure of the world or describe the 
      space of possible worlds is to try to assimilate modal language into 
      descriptivism, rather than seeing them as playing a different expressive 
      role
    - Sellars saw Kant as putting this other option on the table.

## More ideas
- A difference between Humean thinking and Kantian thinking: for Kant, laws of 
  nature are not 'super-facts' - they are not 'describing the world'. Rather, 
  they make explicit a rule of inference.

- Another Kantian idea: the distinction between 
  [*phenomena* and *noumena*](/docs/phil/distinctions/made/noumena_phenomena.qmd).

# Sellars quotes

The lecture finishes with some 
[Sellars](/docs/phil/people/sellars) quotes on describing, explaining, and justifying.

He doesn't begin with philosophically elaborated definition of describing, 
explaining, justifying. He takes these concepts as they come. He wants to do 
philosophy in a neutral / as close-to-practice way as possible.

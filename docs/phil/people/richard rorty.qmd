## Sympathy for Rorty
Brandom says one's sympathy to Rorty is directly proportional to the extent one does find [stories over definitions](/docs/phil/interaction/Having a nature or a history.html) satisfying.

## Nature's own vocabulary

Rorty makes fun of representational realists as being committed to the idea  that there is a thing such as "nature's own language" / "nature's own vocabulary"
   - He sees [Lewis](/docs/phil/people/David Lewis.html) as committed to this as the language which determines what the 'natural properties' are.

## Remark (in conversation)
> Nothing of any philosophical significance has ever happened within 6 feet in 
  any direction of a quantifier symbol

## Irony with Kant
Kant's distinction of [Reasons vs causes](/docs/phil/interaction/Reasons vs causes.html) (i.e. alethic modal vocabulary vs deontic normative vocabulary) is absolutely indispensible to his attack against Kant's representationalist [legacy](/docs/phil/Neokantianism.html): it allows him to show how we can use representational talk for our causal stories while being unsuitable for discussion of justification / entitlement.

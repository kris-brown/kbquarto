## Against phenomenalism
> To claim that the relationship between the framework of sense contents and
that of physical objects can be construed on the phenomalist model (NB: to
think of physical objects as constellations of sense contents) is to commit
oneself to the idea that there are inductively confirmable generalizations (NB:
 subjunctive conditionals) about sense contents which are in principle capable
 of being formulated without the language of physical things. This idea is a
 mistake.

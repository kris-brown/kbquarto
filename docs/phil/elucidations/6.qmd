# What is it?
It's an alternative source of evidence towards philosophical theses. It's not 
always meant to undermine traditional (armchair / mathematical) philosophy.

## Free will example
- Philosphers use "our intuitions" as evidence for a compatibilist view
- Among all our externally determined actions, they need to identify a subset of 
  them as "free" - meaning things for which people can be credited / praised / 
  blamed for.
- Our concept of "freedom" is compatible with our concept of "externally caused"
- To demonstrate this, they use a thought experiment, but empirically we find 
  that the result of that experiment by varying trivial details - calls into 
  doubt whether the thought experiment was only convincing to a biased group of 
  people.
- We tend to believe people can be held accountable when the stakes are higher 
  (the thought experiment example action is trivial => people conclude 
  determinism, the action is something heinous => people conclude compatibilism)

# Why care?
Why do we care what laypeople think over professional philosophers? Are 
philosophers biased away from the truth? Aren't we learning about what people 
say rather than what really is?
  1. We're supplementing traditional philosophy - we want to show philosophical 
     conclusions are not at odds with reality (we at least need an account in 
     light of the evidence, e.g., above)
  2. Laypeople lack prior theoretical commitments to bias them.
  3. A general psychological investigation into how we draw conclusions from 
     evidence (what biases are at play when we go data -> theory) is precisely 
     what philosophy has always done.
    - We can learn how to do philosophy better by understanding, e.g., that we 
      are likely to draw certain conclusions given our human desire to punish.
    - Some of our theories are an expression of current cultural identity 
      rather than universal truth

# Moral consequences
- This is in line with Nietzsche's geneology of morality, which leads to severe 
  relativism. Is this a natural consequence?
  - Experimental philosophy is neutral - people disagreeing about morality is 
    evidence for our knowledge of morality rather than evidence for it being 
    relative
  - Arguments about morality that are based on people sharing intuitions however 
    could be invalidated/validated based on the evidence.
  - Utilitarians may have conclusions that can be demonstrably against layperson 
    ethical intuitions, but they can have independent arguments for why they are 
    still right and our intuitions are wrong.

# Empiricism vs rationalism
  - Do we have faculties that trancend experience?
  - Empiricists see a continuity between what we observe and how we reason
    - Hume argues that we "think in pictures" and arrives at this conclusion by 
      personal reflection.
    - Rationalists like Descartes says we can conceive of distinct figures of 
      1000 vs 999 sides, even if they are visually indistinguishable.
  - This point could be resolved by traditional psychology.

Consider $\mathcal{C}=\boxed{\bullet \rightarrow \bullet}$ and 
$\mathcal{D}=\boxed{\bullet \rightrightarrows \bullet}$. Give two 
[functors](/docs/math/defs/functor.qmd) that act the same on objects but differently on morphisms.

## Solution
Let the two [functors](/docs/math/defs/functor.qmd) map the left object to the left object and 
right object to the right object. The first [functor](/docs/math/defs/functor.qmd) maps the 
nontrivial morphism to the upper morphism in $\mathcal{D}$, whereas the second 
maps it to the lower morphism.

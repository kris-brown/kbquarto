[Author](/docs/phil/people/Wilfrid Sellars.html)

> In characterizing an episode or a state as *knowing*, we are not giving an
 empirical description of it. We are placing it in the logical space of reasons, 
 of justifying and being able to justify what one says. 
 
 — [Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind](/docs/phil/works/Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind.html) §36

- Note, there's nothing too special about *knowing*.  
  - He could also have said *believing*.
- We're *doing* something, an act that's not *describing* something.
- Relates to the [Scienta mensura](/docs/phil/quotes/Scienta mensura.html) quote - we have an example of something 
  (describing knowledge) as something that science is not the measure of all 
  things about.

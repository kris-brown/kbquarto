Crispin Wright's pragmatist-friendly successor notion to "truth".

Related to Peirce's [Truth as the limit of inquiry](/docs/phil/Truth as the limit of inquiry.html).

# Definition 
Something is superassertible when it is assertible[^bjust] and its assertibility is stable and robust under arbitrary increases of our information / evidence.

[^bjust]: best-justified according to our current practices

# Objection
This is circular because we need a notion of truth in order to determine whether a putative piece of information is an "increase" (i.e. it's true).

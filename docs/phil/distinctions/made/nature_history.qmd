When introduced to a new concept, do you prefer to be given a definition for it 
in terms of other concepts, or do you prefer a story of how the word came to be 
used as it's used? Which kind of account is more enlightening? 

- "electrons" and "sulfur" are popularly regarded to have a *nature*. These 
  are the proper subject matter of the Naturwissenschaften.
- "freedom" and "the right to vote" are popularly regarded to have a *history*. 
  These are the proper subject matter of the Geisteswissenshaften.

This can be applied to philosophy itself or major topics in philosophy (ethics,
the mind, knowledge). It is a meta-philosphical problem to establish what kind of 
account is satisfactory. This distinction underlies a fork in the road for 
new German graduate students in philosophy: Kant oder Hegel?

Rorty/Hegel can be thought of as making the meta-philosophical claim that the 
only (specifically) philosophical form of understanding is that of retrospective, 
reconstructive narratives.[^brand]

[^brand]: Brandom says one's sympathy to Rorty is directly proportional to the
          extent one does find stories over definitions satisfying.

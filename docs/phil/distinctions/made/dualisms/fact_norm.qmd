title: Norm fact dualism 
categories: âšª
---

A problem for those who try to address the problem of Cartesian dualism by 
appealing to the *normative* character of intentionality.

- Epistemological questions: 
   - How can we know about norm stuff? in the way we know about mass? 
   - Does it causally affect us? 
- Ontological questions: 
   - Where in the world of natural science do we find these things?

- The [compact closed category](/docs/math/defs/ccsmc.qmd): **Corel**
- A *correlation* $A \rightarrow B$ is an equivalence relation on $A \sqcup B$
- Correlations are composed by the following rule: two elements are equivalent in the composite if we may travel from one to the other while staying within the component equivalence classes of either
- There is a symmetric monoidal structure $(\varnothing, \sqcup)$. For any finite set $A$ there is an equivalence relation on $A \sqcup A$ that partitions elements in the first set from the second. The unit and counit are given by this partition:
    - $\varnothing \xrightarrow{\eta_A} A \sqcup A$
    - $A \sqcup A \xrightarrow{\epsilon_A} \varnothing$

> As long as knowledge is conceived of as accurate representing--as the Mirror of Nature--Quine's and Sellars's holistic doctrines sound pointlessly paradoxical, because such accuracy requires a theory of privileged representations, ones which are automatically and intrinsically accurate. So the response to Sellars on givenness and Quine on analyticity is often that they have "gone too far"-that they have allowed holism to sweep them off their feet and away from common sense.

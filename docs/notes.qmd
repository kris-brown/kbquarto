Organizing / interconnecting my notes helps me make sense of them. Also, I 
make it all public as a discussion starter for friends + to give me pressure 
to make them less trash.

I tried making [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) into a 
"personal wiki" but many features were difficult 
for me to add personally[^1]. 

I'm in the process of moving notes 
[**here**](https://kris-brown.github.io/), generated from 
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

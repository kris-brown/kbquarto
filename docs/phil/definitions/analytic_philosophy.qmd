title: Analytic philosophy
---

Often the task of analytic philosophy is to take statements in some 
potentially-problematic vocabulary and give them an explanation in terms of some 
preferred or unproblematic vocabulary. For example: 

- In a hypothetical society where only a hard scientific vocabulary were uncontroversial:
  - one would get pushback when making statements that refer to "feelings", 
  - but the concern could be addressed by explaining feelings in terms of brain
    chemistry. 
- If people in that society then became comfortable talking about feelings:
  - It would still be problematic to talk about "good" and "evil",
  - but one might try to explain that calling something "evil" is when 
    that thing makes the speaker feel bad.

- Cyber-physical systems have tightly interacting physical and computational parts
- Model system behavior as the passing around and processing of signals (e.g. real numbers).
- Interaction can be thought of as variable sharing
    - Physical coupling between train cars forces their velocity to be the same
- Categorical treatment of [co-design problems](../4/index.qmd) allowed us to evaluate composite feasibility relation from a diagram of simpler feasibility relations.
    - Likewise we can evaluate whether two different signal flow graphs specify the same composite system
    - (perhaps to validate that a system meets a given specification)
- Symmetric monoidal preorders were a special class of symmetric monoidal category where \emph{morphisms} are constrained to be simple (at most one between any pair of objects).
    - Signal flow diagrams can be modeled by props, which is a special class of symmetricf monoidal category where \emph{objects} are constrained to be simple (all are generaated by the monoidal product of a single object).
    - In the former we have to label wires but not boxes. Vice-versa for props.

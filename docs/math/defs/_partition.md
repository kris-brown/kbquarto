A set $P$ ('part labels') and, for each $p \in P$, a 
nonempty subset ('*p*th part') $A_p \subseteq A$ such that:

  1. $A = \bigcup_{p \in P}A_p$
  2. $p \ne q \implies A_p \cap A_q = \varnothing$

Two partitions are considered the same if the partitioned groups are the same, 
the labels don't matter.

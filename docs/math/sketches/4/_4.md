## The basic idea

- General idea: take a thing we know and add structure to it such that things 
  that were formerly *properties* become *structures*
- Do in such a way as to be able to recover the thing we categorified by 
  forgetting the new structure.
- In categorified world, we have more structure available to talk about the 
  relationships between objects.
- An example is how we treated preorders as categories.
- Ordinary categories are **Set**-categories

## Monoidal categories

- Just like [preorders](/docs/math/defs/preorder.qmd) are special kinds of 
  [categories](/docs/math/defs/cat.qmd), 
  [symmetric monoidal preorders](/docs/math/defs/smp.qmd) are special kinds of 
  [monoidal categories](/docs/math/defs/smc.qmd).
- Just as we can consider $\mathcal{V}$ [categories](/docs/math/defs/vcat.qmd) 
  for a [symmetric monoidal preorder](/docs/math/defs/smp.qmd), we can consider 
  $\mathcal{V}$ [categories](/docs/math/defs/vcat.qmd) when $\mathcal{V}$ is a 
  [monoidal category](/docs/math/defs/smc.qmd).
- One difference is that associativity is up to isomorphism: e.g. products in
  set $S \times (T \times U)$ vs $(S \times T) \times U$
- When the isomorphisms of a 
  [symmetric monoidal category](/docs/math/defs/smc.qmd) are replaced with 
  equalities, we call it *strict*
    - Due to "Mac Lane's coherence theorem" we can basically treat all as 
      strict...something we implicitly do when writing wiring diagrams.

## Categories enriched in a SMC

- We said that ordinary categories were just **Set**-categories, but our 
  definition of $\mathcal{V}$ categories required the $\mathcal{V}$ to be a 
  preorder!
- We have to generalize (categorify) $\mathcal{V}$ categories.
- Symmetric monoidal preorders can be considered as symmetric monoidal 
  categories, despite not providing the data for identities and 
  composition (these are not needed because there is no choice).
    - Example of property becoming structure: $I \leq \mathcal{X}(x,x)$ is
      a property of $\mathcal{V}$ 
      [categories as defined earlier](/docs/math/defs/vcat.qmd) but 
      become part of the structure in the 
      [categorified version of the definition](/docs/math/defs/enrich_smc.qmd).

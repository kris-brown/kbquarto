From [-@brandom2019some]:

- Imagine a community that talked about having gold or silver in one's teeth
   - Later, the community extends that practice to talk about having pain in 
     one's teeth.
- If, as a matter of contingent fact, the practitioners can learn to use the 
  expression 'in' in the new way, building on (but adapting) the old, they will 
  have fundamentally changed the *meaning* of 'in'.
    - This can be seen by the fact that, in the old practice, it made sense to 
      ask where the gold was before it was in one's tooth, whereas in the new 
      practice asking where the pain was before it was in the tooth can lead 
      only to a distinctively philosophical kind of puzzlement.

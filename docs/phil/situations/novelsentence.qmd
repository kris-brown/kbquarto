We can sometimes underestimate the generativity of language and its radical 
novelty. Consider something as easy to understand as "For the picnic today, 
I hope you packed all the sandwiches we made last night and the baseball gear."

novel. Not just in the sense that that speaker has never produced or heard that 
sequence of words, but in the sense that *no one ever has*.

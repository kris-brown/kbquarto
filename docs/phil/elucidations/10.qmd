# Two notions of good
- Distinction: good (absolutely) vs good for something vs good <noun>
  - E.g. It's good to be kind, it's good for me to study math, that's a good car
- British 20th centurary moral philosophers like GE Moore don't like "good for 
  X" wanting a morality that is not egoistic, instead trying to frame in terms 
  of absolute good.
  - These theories overlooked possible justifications which use "good for" but 
    are not egoistic.
  - Absolute good is a much more abstract / questionable concept, so it would be 
    nice to frame ethics without it if possible.
# Is there bad
  - These may be different (absolute good is incoherent, but not absolute bad) 
    but Kraut needs neither.
  - It's coherent to say "pain is bad", but we also say "it's bad for me to 
    feel pain". What more is gained by using absolute language?
  - What about cruelty/cowardice?
    - Again we can show that these things are bad because they are bad for 
      people.

# Moral consequences
- Does this point of view lead to egoism, e.g. good/bad being instrumental to 
  what we want?
  - Mistake to conflate "good for me" as "what I want" or "good for some end I 
    want".
  - There are objective truths of what is good for certain types of beings, even 
    if we're ignorant.
  - There are differences and similarities for what is good for different 
    people/species.
    - Cannot apply same formula to each case.

# Issues
- What problems does thinking about morality in terms of absolute good have?
  - It's not necessarily bad. But it could be used to justify something that is 
    bad for everybody.

# Practical applications
## Euthenasia
- Argument against euthansisa: life itself is good (would not be sufficient if 
  Kraut's thesis is accepted)

## Conflicting interests
- E.g. good for A to be loud, good for B to be in quiet environment
- We should organize political institutions to avoid needless conflict.
- The concept of justice is needed to resolve these cases.
    - "Absolute Good" not needed

# My response at the time
- We can frame some instances of absolute good/bad in terms of good for, but the 
  interesting question is can this be done for all uses?
    - if absolute bad exists, then it does seem possible that an institituion / 
      relationship is good for everyone involved but still is bad (or vice 
      versa). E.g. euthansia.
    - Kraut's grammar of moral terms should not alter this fact.

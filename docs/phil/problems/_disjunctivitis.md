Suppose someone says "It's cold outside!" and you want to know if they mean it's 
below 40 degrees rather than below 60 degrees. One way to tell what they mean is 
to put them in 40 degree weather and witness them say "It's cold outside", then 
put them in 60 degree weather and witness them say "It's not cold outside!".

Now let's abstract that: a straightforward way to tell if someone saying $P$ 
means $\phi$ rather than $\psi$ is to show them $\phi$'s 
(and witness them say $P$) and then show them 
$\psi$'s (and witness them not say $P$). Call this witnessing the distinction 
via *dispositions* of the $P$-speaker. *Disjunctivitis* is a thought experiment 
that says this is *not* a sufficient tool for us to distinguish $\phi$'s and 
$\psi$'s generally. [^1]

We're worried about whether the word 'porcupine' really means *porcupine*, or 
whether it means *porcupine or echidna*. Because most of us porcupine users 
can't tell porcupines from Australian echidnas. And, although everything I've 
ever seen in called a 'porcupine' was a *porcupine*, everything I've ever seen 
called a 'porcupine' was also a *porcupine or echidna*. And the question is, 
well, in virtue of what fact is it 'porcupine' actually means *porcupine*, 
and not *porcupine or echidna*?

You can't tell it from my dispositions on the output side. On the input 
side, although it might have been equally true that they've all been *porcupines*, they've also been *porcupines or echidnas*. (Furthermore, for 
all I know, they all happened to have been been male porcupines, in which 
case we have to worry that my word 'porcupine' means *male porcupines*, and, again, I can't tell them from the female ones.)

Solution from [Sellars](/docs/phil/people/sellars/index.qmd): the people who 
taught you the word 'porcupine', what 
pattern were they trying to inculcate in you? Was it to say 'porcupine' when 
confronted with a *porcupine or echidna*? This is a crucial piece of how the 
noise 'porcupine' coming out of my mouth means *porcupine*.

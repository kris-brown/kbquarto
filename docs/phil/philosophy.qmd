# Goal 
- Sellars' view: [Goal of philosophy](/docs/phil/Goal of philosophy.html)
	- He describes the major problem of his time as reconciling the "clash" between "the 'manifest' image of man-in-the-world" and "the scientific image".

# Relation to other disciplines

Philosophy "with a capital P" is the "queen of the sciences". All scientific knowledge is representational or concerned with knowledge, so if philosophy has a special insight into representation or knowledge, then the other disciplines must answer to it. 

This style and status of philosophy is challenged by [Rorty](/docs/phil/Richard Rorty.html).

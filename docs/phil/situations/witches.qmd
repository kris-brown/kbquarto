Jones says "The witch who lives in the house at the end of the street really 
scares me." We, not believing in the myth of witches, can have a couple of 
reactions to this:

1. Jones referred to the woman who lives at the end of the street, and the 
   fact he implicitly described her as a witch just betrays some false 
   auxillary belief he has about witches.
2. Jones *failed to refer* to the woman at the end of the street because she 
   isn't a witch (since no witches exist).

Even if you'd prefer option 1 or option 2, the other option likely seems pretty 
reasonable.

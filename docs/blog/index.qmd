There are a few draft posts pending, but in the meantime here are two posts I 
made to the [AlgebraicJulia blog](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/blog/):

- [Equality vs equivalence: computing isomorphism classes of C-sets](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/blog/post/2022/01/cset-automorphisms/)
- [The chase: data repair and logical reasoning](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/blog/post/2022/06/chase/)

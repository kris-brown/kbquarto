He is called an *atomist* about 
[representation](/docs/phil/definitions/representation.qmd) by Brandom when he talks about the 
relation between 'horses' and *horses*. Fodor says we have to be able to 
understand that in terms of those items and their relations, independently of 
the relation of *horses* to any other representing, or of 'horses' to any other 
represented things.
- 'A' means *A* iff all and only *A*'s cause 'A's.

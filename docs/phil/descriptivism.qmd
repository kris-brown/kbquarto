Descriptivism is a [semantic](/docs/phil/Semantics.html) theory: the belief that what you do with language is describe things.

It was an improvement in the philosophy of language which allowed us to avoid the 
[Hesperus Phosphorus puzzle](/docs/phil/Hesperus and Phosphorus.html).

A criticism of it is that it is too narrow of a box: many genuine uses of language are not descriptive (in the narrow sense), while descriptivism would make these uses second-class citizens. (For this reason, Sellars calls descriptivism "nothing-but-ism").

Seven tenants, according to [-@soames2005reference]:

1. One must distinguish between the meaning of a linguistic expression and its 
   referent; for most any linguistic expression (including proper names), its 
   meaning is given by a description, which determines its referent.
2. Understanding a linguistic expression consists in mentally grasping its
   meaning and associating this meaning with the expression.
3. Meaning is transparent; that is, if two linguistic expressions have the same 
   meaning, then anyone who understands them can tell that this is the case. 
   (Because anyone who understands an expression mentally grasps its meaning 
   and associates that meaning with the expression, a person who understands 
   two expressions can tell whether he has mentally grasped the same meaning 
   and associated it with each of them.)
4. The meaning of a linguistic expression and the content of a mental state it 
   expresses are determined entirely by internal features of the person in 
   question. (Because the meaning of an expression is something that is mentally 
   grasped by someone who comprehends the language in question, a personâ€™s 
   physical and social environments have no direct impact on the meanings of 
   her expressions.)
5. A proposition is *a priori* if and only if it is necessary; both *a priority* and 
   necessity are explained in terms of meaning. (Because the meaning of an 
   expression is something that is mentally grasped by someone who comprehends 
   the language in question, simply comprehending a language enables one to 
   know certain truths that are grounded in the meanings of the expressions of
   that language.)
6. Anti-essentialism
7. The aim of philosophy is conceptual analysis

# Wittgenstein
- The [Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](/docs/phil/works/Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.html) was supremely descriptivist.
- Yet it made a key advance by noting that logical expressions play a different kind of role 
    - Prior to the Tractatus, Russell would be looking into the world to try to 
      see what distinguishes positive from negative facts, when he should not have
      been looking to the world.
    - After the Tractatus, even descriptivists accepted that logical vocabulary 
      does not describe.
- Sellars extends this even further. Also the later Wittgenstein recoiled from   
  descriptivism and saw language as playing an unsurveyable variety of roles.

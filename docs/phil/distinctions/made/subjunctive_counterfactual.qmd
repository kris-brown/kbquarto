title: Subjunctive vs counterfactual conditionals
---
:::{.callout-warning}
These notes were hastily made for personal use. In the future they'll be made more presentable.
:::

- Subjunctive conditional: if $X$ were $\psi$'d, it would $\phi$.
    - (example?)
- Counterfactual conditional: if $X$ *had been* $\psi$'d, it would have $\phi$'d.
- These are both counterfactuals but very different:
    - If Oswalt didn't shoot Kennedy, then some one else did.
    - If Oswalt didn't shoot Kennedy, then someone else would have.

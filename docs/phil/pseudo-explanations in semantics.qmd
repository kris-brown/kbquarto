> It is no truer that "atoms are what they are because we use 'atom' as we do" than that "we use 'atom' as we do because atoms are as they are." *Both* of these claims, the antirepresentationlist says, are entirely empty. Both are pseudo-explanations. It is particularly important that the antirepresentationalist insist that the *latter* claim is a pseudo-explanation.

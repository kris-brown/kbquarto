For any category $\mathcal{C}$ there is exactly one functor to the category 
**1**, let's call it $!$ Where does it send each object and each morphism?

## Solution
There is only one object to send each object to and only one morphism to send 
each morphism to. Because everything in the target is equal to everything else, 
all functor constraints are trivially satisfied.

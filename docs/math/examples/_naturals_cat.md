- The natural numbers as a [free category](/docs/math/defs/freecat.qmd): 
  $\boxed{\overset{\bullet}{z}\circlearrowleft s}$
- There are infinitely many paths, in bijection with the natural numbers.
- This is a category with one object, also called a *monoid*.
- The composition operation corresponds to the addition operation.
- Unitality and associativity give us the usual constraints on a monoid.

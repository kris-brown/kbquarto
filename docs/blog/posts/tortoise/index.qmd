- This seems analogous to descriptivism vs expressivism.

- It illustrates what we lose when we reduce all discourse to descriptive 
  discourse. When we choose our definitions such that natural laws are facts 
  in the world, just like any other ordinary empirical fact, we lose both:
    1. Their role in reasoning
    2. A story for our knowledge/justification of them.

- The story shows how treating a rule as a fact strips it of its normative 
  force. It is the problem of conflating description in the narrow sense with 
  description in the wider sense.

- The last line of Brandom's commentary makes me think this can also be used to 
  counter some forms of radical skepticism, i.e. to recover an air of dignity 
  to making working assumptions.

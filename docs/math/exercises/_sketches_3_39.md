Say where each of the 10 morphisms in the free square category are mapped to by 
a functor to the commutative square category (where $Ob(F)$ maps each corner to 
the same corner).

## Solution
The four identity morphisms and four length-1 paths are trivially mapped to the 
corresponding morphisms.  Both length-2 paths in the free category are mapped to 
the same morphism, $f;h$.

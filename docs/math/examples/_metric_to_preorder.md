- Consider the function $[0,\infty] \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{B}$ which maps 0 to 
  $true$ and otherwise to $false$.
- Can check that $f$ is monotonic and preserves the monoidal product+unit, so it 
  is a [monoidal monotone](/docs/math/defs/monoidal_monotone.qmd). (this was 
  shown in [Exercise 2.44](/docs/math/exercises/sketches_2_44.qmd))
- Thus we have a tool to convert metric spaces into preorders.

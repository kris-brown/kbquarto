- *Descriptive* concepts are not the only kinds of concepts. There
  is a temptation of [empiricists](/docs/phil/definitions/empiricism.qmd) 
  in assimilating all expressions to
  descriptive expressions (such that anything not intelligible as
  descriptive is defective).
- The negation of this is called 
  [*decriptivism*](/docs/phil/definitions/descriptivism.qmd).

- The "non-logical" qualifier is there because Sellars assumes everyone has 
  already accepted the 
  [Tractarian](/docs/phil/definitions/descriptivism.qmd#wittgenstein) lesson 
  that logical expressions do not describe.

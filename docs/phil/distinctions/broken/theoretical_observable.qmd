# Theoretical vs observable objects

It is commonly reasoned that abstract or theoretical objects and concrete observable objects are simply different types of things. The example of [Pluto](/docs/phil/situations/pluto.qmd) makes it clear that what we really want to make is a distinction of how we *come to know* of something, rather than thinking about ontologicall different things.

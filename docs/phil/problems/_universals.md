It seems there is no problem thinking about what triangles and white things are, 
but what of triangularity and whiteness?

## An answer

This seems to be an instance of the [tooth pain](/docs/phil/situations/toothpain.qmd) 
issue. Noun-ness was for ordinary objects (with obvious ontological status) in 
an earlier game, but our creativity with language led us to nounify many other 
words, leading to 'objects' with unclear ontological status.

### Realism

Realism asserts that universals are real things, that *triangularity* does refer 
to something in the world, although perhaps some metaphysical realm.

[Plato](/docs/phil/people/plato/index.qmd) is an example.

### Nominalism

[Berkeley](/docs/phil/people/berkeley/index.qmd) rejected Locke's view of abstract ideas on empiricist grounds. For him 
*triangularity* is just a name that refers to all triangles, rather than 
referring to something in particular.

There are no abstract ideas, just particulars.

### Conceptual nominalism

One can accept that universals refer to things in the world but be clear that 
they are mental things (concepts). [Locke](/docs/phil/people/locke/index.qmd) is an example.

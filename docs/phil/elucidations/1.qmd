We want a theory of desire that can answer questions like: given a scenario 
and a desire, was that desire satisfied?

Notably, we are *not* asking whether a person with that desire was happy or 
not afterwards.

# Conventional wisdom
Conventionally, desire corresponds to a desired state of the world, and 
satisfaction is whether or not that state is obtained.

A challenging scenario for this view: a man is rushing to catch a important 
train to NYC and boards at the last 
second, only to realize afterward that the train is heading to the wrong 
destination. Was his desire satisfied?

- **No** - eliminitivist
  - We reject that the than man desired to get on the train to a wrong 
    destination, because his 'true' desire involved to see the doctor in 
    NYC, which is inconsistent with being on the wrong train.
  - Problem:
    - The doctor was going to tell him if his disease was curable, so what 
      his 'true' desire is the cure, not the train to NYC. [^1]
    - I.e. the naive eliminitivist accidentally eliminates all desires other 
      than the desire for 'the good'.
- **Yes** - separatist
  - Introduce another desire to make sense of why the man is upset despite 
    the desire being satisfied. The 'catch-this-train' desire was satisfied, 
    but 'get to NYC' that was not satisfied.
  - Problems
    - This account makes the desires seem separate/atomic, but why do they 
      seem so intimately connected to each other?
    - If he learned just before that it was going to the wrong destination, 
      his desire to catch the (that) train would instantly vanish.
    - Also this makes desires in principle unconnected from what is good for us.

[^1]: This can be done ad infinitum: his true desire is not the cure but rather 
      good health, or happiness, and so on, until you reach a terminal desire
      ("the Good").

# Challenging the conventional wisdom: Desire = Object + Aim
  When you want anything, you want more than one thing, so it's complicated to 
  answer "did you get what you want".

  - The man wanted to catch the train *and* wanted to get to NYC; those are both 
    aspects of his *single* desire.

  There is a specific side and a general side to a desire
    - Object of desire: ("catching this train")
    - Aim: what makes the object appealing.

# Relation between desire and belief
  Conventional wisdom holds they are both representable merely as states of 
the world, although they have an complementary relationship:

- We want to update our belief state to match the world, 
- we want to update the world to match our belief state.

This picture is incomplete. Example: feel hungry, desire food.

- It can't be an accident that a bunch of seemingly related desires pop up 
  (want a sandwich downstairs, want pasta from next door, ...)
- It doesn't make sense that we desire things in a way that is not 
  possible (want sandwich from Paris, from the moon)
- Things make more sense when we break down the structure of a desire:
  - Object: sandwich from deli downstairs, sandwich
  - Aim: satisfy the hunger

# Summary slogan: "Satisfaction as a compromise"

These thoughts might inspire positive change in fields like economics, where 
people's desires are taken to be "given in advance". 
Their framework involves setting up a system that optimizes utility, given 
  desires (as the fixed input data), but rather the desires are adaptive to the world / how things are achieved.

Parents try don't satisfy children's desires because they don't have the 
right desires. The desires are formed on the reflection of prior experience 
(knowing what to want, how to achieve it).

The story of the formation of the desire is required towards understanding 
    what it means to satisfy it.

> To say that a person desired to do A, thought it his duty to do B, but was 
forced to do C, is not to describe him as one might describe a scientific 
specimin. One does indeed describe him, but one does something more. And it's 
this 'something more' which is the irreducible core of the framework of persons. 
In what does this 'something more' consist? To think of a featherless bird as a 
person is to think of it as a being with which  one is bound up in a network of 
duties. From this point of view, the irreducibility of the personal is the 
irreducibility of the *ought* or the *is*. But even more basic than this to 
think of a featherless biped as a person is to construe its behavior in terms of 
actual or potential membership in an embracing group, each member of which 
thinks of itself as a member of the group. Let's call such a group a *community*. - Section VII

A semantic theory associated with [Davidson](/docs/phil/people/Donald Davidson.html).

What you believe / what your words mean (which have to be determined together) are whatever the best interpretation of your behavior would take them to be (that which best rationalizes your behavior).

That's not just the best grip we've got - that's what it *is* to mean something.

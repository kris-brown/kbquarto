Check that the product $X \xleftarrow{p_X} X \times Y \xrightarrow{p_Y} Y$ is 
terminal object in $\mathbf{Cone}(X,Y)$

## Solution
The existence and uniqueness of the morphism to the product object in the 
product definition are the conditions of being a terminal object in 
$\mathbf{Cone}(X,Y)$. The maps of the terminal object to $X$ and $Y$ are the 
projection maps of the product.

I think of the last sentence of 
[this](/docs/phil/quotes/transposed language of norms.qmd)
in the following way: the $\square$ operator can be applied to
statements to make them *modal* (which could be alethic, deontic, or many other
things like "Jones thinks that ..."). 

One such $\square$ is "Semantically, ...". (or, "Literally, ..."). 

Ordinary statements made in practical life
could be interpreted as having an implicit "Pragmatically, ..." (in fact,
could we define [*pragmatics*](/docs/phil/pragmatics.qmd) 
to be that which plays this role?)

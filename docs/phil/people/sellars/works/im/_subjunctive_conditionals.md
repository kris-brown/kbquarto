> We've established not only that subjunctive conditionals are the expressions 
of material rules of inference, but that the authority of those rules is not 
derivative from formal rules. In other words, we've shown that material rules 
of inference are essential to the language we speak, for we make constant use 
of subjunctive conditions. It's very tempting to conclude that material rules 
of inference are essential to languages containing descriptive terms. - Section III

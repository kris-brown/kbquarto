There are many flavors, but consider the *brain in a vat* 
[thought experiment](https://iep.utm.edu/brainvat/):

- You are sleeping one night, when the scientist takes out your brain, puts it 
  in a vat, and connects its neurons to a machine that gives/receives electrical 
  inputs such that the brain activity is identical to certain possible real 
  life scenarios if the brain was still in the body.
- The brain in the vat could be having the same experiences I am having right 
  now, so why can I be confident that I am not a brain in a vat?

Charles Sanders Pierce

# Relation to Sellars, habits, and rules
For Sellars, the word 'habit' denotes a mere regularity. For Pierce, habit is a 
normative concept. 

He observes that the Latin form in which Newton lies down in Principia is the 
same form a notice board that says "Neckties will be worn in the office".

Sellars would call this notion of normativity "ought-to-be".

Consider $\mathbf{Cost}^{op}$. What is it as a preorder? What is its unit and product?

## Solution
As a preorder, the domain is still $[0,\infty]$ and ordered by the natural 
$\leq$ relation.  The unit and product are unchanged by taking the opposite 
preorder, so they are still $0, +$ respectively.

- Consider the following category: 
  $\boxed{\overset{\bullet}{z}\circlearrowleft s\ \ \boxed{s;s = s}}$
- A [functor](/docs/math/defs/functor.qmd) from this category to **Set} is a set $Z$ and an 
  involution function $Z \rightarrow Z$.
  - $Z =$ natural numbers and a function sending everything to zero (zero is 
    sent to zero)
  - $Z =$ set of well-formed arithmetic expressions (e.g. $12+(2*4)$) and a 
    function which evaluates to an integer (which itself is a well-formed 
    expression). Evaluation on integers does nothing.
  - A function which sends numbers greater than 2 to their smallest prime factor 
    (this is a no-op on the prime factors themselves).

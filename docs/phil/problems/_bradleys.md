Original argument appearring in Chapters II and III of [-@bradley2016appearance}] 
(originally 1893), and S.E.P. commentary [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bradley-regress):

- Bradley notes that there appears to be such a thing as 'a lump of sugar', and 
  this thing appears to have qualities such as *whiteness*, *sweetness*, and
  *hardness*.
  - But what is this "thing" that bears properties?
    - On the one hand, it's odd to assume that there is something to the lump of 
      sugar *beside* its several qualities
        - So, postulating a property-less bearer of properties is incoherent.
    - On the other hand, he notes that the lump cannot merely be its qualities 
      either, since the latter must somehow be united.
- For Bradley, unity or "coexistence" of qualities presupposes *relations*.
- But the ontology of relations is prone to the following infinite regress:
    - We postulate the relation $C$ that relates properties $A$ and $B$
    - We then need a relation to relate $C$ to $A$ (and to $B$).

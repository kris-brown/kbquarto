Huw Price is an Australian philosopher, born 1953.

On the subject of representation, he places himself conceptually in between [Brandom](/docs/phil/people/Robert Brandom.html) and [Rorty](/docs/phil/people/Richard Rorty.html).

> In according this kind of centrality to assertion, I’m one step closer to the orthodoxy than the view—arguably Wittgenstein’s, and perhaps Rorty’s—that even this much representationalism is too much: hence my one cheer for representationalism. But I am one step further from the orthodoxy than the view that Brandom appears at least tempted to adopt, which aims to build a substantial notion of representational content from expressivist and pragmatist raw materials.

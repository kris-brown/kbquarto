The is-ought problem. [David Hume](/docs/phil/David Hume.html). 

The infeasibility of reducing "ought talk" to "is talk" is the same problem [(according to Sellars)](/docs/phil/On community.html)
as reducing "the personal" (e.g. believing) to something at the individual rather than community (network of rights and duties) level.

# Introduction
Brandom believes Sellars to be the most important American philosopher of the 
20th century. Some ways in which Sellars was remarkable:

- Sellars had a systematic / synoptic vision, which was rare for 
  analytic philosophers (who largely preferred to write 'gem-like' articles). 
  - This makes it also hard to read Sellars - it's hard to get a hold of one piece 
    of it without getting the whole. 
- Sellars had an almost unique knowledge of and 
  appreciation for the significance of the *history* of philosophy 
  - (not just a subdiscipline, but rather as the language in which philosophy is pursued).[^world]
- Sellars' overall aim was to move analytic philosophy from its Humean phase to its Kantian phase.
  - Epitomizes his views towards empiricism/naturalism (which had characterized 
    analytic philosophy). 
  - That Kant was worth respecting a radical view at the time - he had been 
    written out of the canon due to his connection to 
    [Hegel](/docs/phil/people/brandom#on-kant-and-hegel).[^1]
  - Rawls on the practical side and Strawson/Bennett on the practical side 
    brough Kant back into respectability in Anglaphone circles, but Sellars was 
    way out in front of this (and appreciated the significance of Kant deeper). 
  - This is also why Sellars wasn't so influential - people didn't understand 
    the Kant needed to appreciate him.

## Kant's influence on Sellars
Kant's big idea:

What is sapience? (what distinguishes *knowers* and mere responders to an environment?)

- It's not some presence of "mind-stuff" (i.e. Cartesian dualism)
- It's that judgments and intentional doings are things that knowers and agents 
    are in a distinctive sense *responsible for*.
- Judgments express commitments of those subjects / their exercises of authority 
- The difference between mind minded things and 
unmined and things isn't an ontological one, but a *de*ontological one.

*Judgment* is important for Kant 

- it is the minimal thing that we can 
be held accountable for (the smallest unit of consciousness)
- The form of the judgment has two parts:
  - Subjective: the "I think ..." that can accompany any judgment 
    - *Who* is responsible
  - Objective: "object = x" 
    - what you make yourself responsible *to* by taking the judgment
    - what you need to consult in order to determine the correctness

Cartesian questions are about our grip on concepts. Thinking about concepts as 
rules for making judgments, Kantian questions are about the concepts' grip on us.

- A concept is the rule you bind yourself to by calling the coin 'copper'. (You 
commit yourself, whether you know it or not, to it's being an electrical
conductor, melting at a particular temperature, etc.).

- Rather than a Cartesian mind-body problem, it's a norm-fact problem. The relationship 
  between prescription and description - that's what is special about *us*.

Hegel took this Kantian question and observed that normative status are 
socially instituted statuses - we have to look at social practices to understand 
what responsibility / authority are. (this idea was reintroduced indepenently 
by the later Wittgenstein - for example his 
[children's game](/docs/phil/situations/childrensgame.qmd) investigates the 
normative significance of beliefs/desires/intentions).


Sellars on what is philosophy: "the attempt to say how things, in the largest 
sense of that term, hang together, in the largest sense of that term." 


[^world]: This is one dimension along which the world spirit has caught up with 
          Sellars.


# Core programs of analytical philosophy
Analytic philosophy held together as being a *semantic* project. 

- Understand the meanings of potentially-problematic target vocabularies in 
  terms of the meanings of putatively-unproblematic base vocabularies. 
  - Some debate over what the relation between target and base vocabularies 
    needs to be:
    - definability
    - translatability
    - paraphrasability
    - "analyzable in terms of"
    - reducibility
    - supervenience
- Examples:
  - *On denoting*: problematic vocabulary is definite descriptions, translated 
    into the unproblematic vocabulary of FOL with identity.
  - Frege's problematic vocabulary was arithmatic statements, which were made 
    sense of in quantificational logic with identity.
- Things like intentional, normative, metaphysical vocabularies were typically 
  problematic.
  - Core programs of empiricism and naturalism can be understood as having 
    different choice of base vocabularies
    - Empiricism: base language is sensory experience (e.g. a language of sense 
      data, language of how things seem or appear)
    - Naturalism: language of natural science (possibly just fundamental 
      physics or broader)
    - The Vienna Circle was divided into two wings. Schlict (empiricist) and Neurath 
      (naturalist), and Carnap in between. Prime source of tension between them was 
      modality / lawlikeness. 
  - *Functionalism*: Unproblematic vocabulary is talking about how something 
    plays a role in a larger system. (paradigmatically shows up in the 
    philosophy of mind.)
      - Sellars was the first functionalist. broader than the sense that it 
        comes up in the philosophy of mind: Sellars is a *semantic* functionalist.

Another reason why Sellars is important is his distinctive views about 
empiricism, naturalism, and functionalism.

## Role of logic 

Logic as developed in the early 20th century is a powerful tool for giving us 
inferential control. Logical empiricists found this tool indispensible. 
They viewed the early empiricists (e.g. Locke, Hume) as 
having the right building blocks, but "association" was too weak of a mortar to 
hold them together and build the edifice of knowledge of the objective world.
Although Sellars isn't a logical empiricist, he also found logic to be a useful
tool and can be thought of as a logical Kantian. After Kant, the nextmost 
important philosopher for Sellars was Carnap. (despite Carnap's empiricism.)

# Summary of views

It is debated whether or not Sellars was an reductive naturalist, but Brandom does not 
think so.

{{< include /docs/phil/people/sellars/works/epm/_space_of_reasons.md >}}

- This is a powerful weapon against empiricist reductionisms of all sorts, 
  according to Brandom.


There is a Cartesian dualism threatening the tradition that Kant is overcoming.
Is Sellars replacing this with a norm-fact dualism? 

What is a dualism? What a distinction becomes when it is drawn in such terms 
that the relation between the distinguished terms becomes unintelligible. 
Complaint about Cartesian dualism:

- if you're committed to "mind stuff" being non-extended.
- and to the physical world being extended.
- throw in some general claims about causation (e.g. it occurs in a place)
- then perception and agency become unintelligble (how is the mind affected by real stuff / how can the mind cause something?)

For norm fact distinction. 
- Epistemological questions: 
   - How can we know about norm stuff? in the way we know about mass? 
   - Does it causally affect us? 
- Ontological questions: 
   - Where in the world of natural science do we find these things?

A reductive naturalist doesn't have to face this threat of a dualism. But one 
loses the meaning.

## A Kantian idea that sellars never lost sight of: the transcendental move

The conceptual framework that makes it possible to give matter-of-factual 
descriptions of how things actually are - that framework has essential features 
which can also be put into words - but those words will not be playing the role 
of describing things how they are. For example: alethic modal vocabulary.

To *describe* things you have to commit yourself to inferential relations that are 
counterfactually robust (otherwise you're merely labeling).

Hume thought he could understand what means for the cat to be on the mat but not 
that it is impossible for the cat to be weightless or as big as the sun. Sellars 
says that, unless you make *some* distinction about what is possible/necessary for cats 
and what is not (note you don't have to get it *right*), you can't count as 
applying the  concept *cat* to describe something. So you can't be in the 
predicament Hume thought he was in. The argument is seen in 
[Counterfactuals, Dispositions, and the Causal Modalities](/docs/phil/people/sellars/works/cdcm).

A 'master idea' that Sellars never explicitly says at this level of generality:

every philosophically interesting/problematic vocabulary turns out metalinguistic:

- logical vocabulary:
  - "if ... then ..." does not describe something in the world but makes explicit inferential commitments that articulate the contents of concepts that do (in the narrow sense) describe thing
- alethetic modal vocabulary 
  - Makes what you are doing with subjunctives explicit
- normative vocabulray
- semantic vocabulary
  - because it's true of normative and modal vocabulary
- intentional vocabulary
  - because it's true of semantic vocabulary
- ontological vocabulary
  - e.g. universals

His strategy for dealing with problematic vocabulary is to treat as metalinguistic.

His notion of metalinguistic isn't made explicit anywhere. It's more flexible 
than for Carnap. One attempt at explaining it: what metalinguistic discourses 
do is functionally classify bits of vocabulary. He thinks of it as transcendental
grammar.

Pragmatic dependencies make explicit conceptual dependencies. 

- E.g. "Looks $\phi$" talk depends on "Is $\phi$" talk. ([EPM](/docs/phil/people/sellars/works/epm))

## Cautionary tale about saying things aren't descriptive
First-wave metaethical expressivists said that the role ethical vocabulary played was not 
to *describe* but rather to express attitudes (e.g. approval, disapproval). But 
Geach showed that there exist *some* descriptive content due to the intelligibility 
of "If he ought to do X, then he has reason to do X" (one is not expressing 
approval of doing X).

# Conclusion
Kant is a empirical realist, transcendental idealist. Sellars is an empirical 
naturalist, but a trancendental non-naturalist. This gives Sellars his unique 
perspective on the problems of philosophy.

- the empricial naturalism is epitomized by 
  [Scientium mensura](/docs/phil/people/sellars/works/epm/scientia.qmd)
- the transcendental non-naturalism comes from the ineliminble expressive role 
  that is played by metalinguistic expressions 
  - There is no prospect of getting rid of that in our discourse
  - Yet it is also not in the jurisdiction of science.

Despite Sellars is concerned with transposing things into a linguistic key 
and sees the significance of conceptual change, he is still a Kantian rather than 
a Hegelian. 

- He wants to figure out what was happening around the time of Newton and Locke.
- He does not see that there's one phenomenon of which the scientific revolution is one manifestation. And the French Revolution is another. 
  - Hegel saw that there was such a thing as modernity
  - Brandom says you don't get to count as a Hegelian unless you're concerned 
    with that whole thing, rather than just the scientific revolution.

# Personal note
When Brandom joined the department in '76, Sellars was a bitter, grumpy old man, aged 65.
This surprised Brandom in his youthful innocence (how could you be unhappy when
you've been so philosophically accomplished? just think about your accomplishments!).

1. It's taken until Kant's death until now for anybody (i.e. Sellars) to figure out  
   what he was on about. He thought he'd get the same fate.
2. He felt he'd been treated badly by the profession.
  - He hadn't written anything until he was age 35.
  - In 1956 he had three lectures in London which were a stunning success.
  - In 1960, more dissertations were written on Sellars than any other living 
    philosopher.
  - But that was the same year _Word and Object_ came out. It was a tidal wave.
  - Only thing that interrupted that wave, if anything, in the next decade was 
    _Naming and Necessity_.
  - Sellars' Locke lectures in 1963 were utterly disasterous. Sellars never 
    recovered from this. On his deathbed he said it was the worst experience of 
    his life.
  - He had the view, admirable but disasterous, to only deliver unfinished work 
    at seminars (let's work out these ideas together, I don't want to tell you 
    something that I have no chance of changing my mind about - that's what 
    written publishing is for).
  - At age 45 he was finally getting the respect he deserved and 9 years later 
    it was all over.

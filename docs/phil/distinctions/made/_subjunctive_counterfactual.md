- Subjunctive conditional: if $X$ were $\psi$'d, it would $\phi$.
    - (example?)
- Counterfactual conditional: if $X$ *had been* $\psi$'d, it would have $\phi$'d.
- These are both counterfactuals but very different:
    - If Oswalt didn't shoot Kennedy, then some one else did.
    - If Oswalt didn't shoot Kennedy, then someone else would have.
